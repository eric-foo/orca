"""Pass 2 of transcript product extraction: deterministic, LLM-free verdict fusion.

Consumes Pass-1 ``ProductMention``s for ONE creator and produces a ``ProductVerdictSet``:
one ``ProductVerdict`` per ``(brand, line)``. LLM-free by construction (it lives in the
no-LLM zone, ``scoring/``): Pass 1 READS and LABELS; this code DECIDES and COMBINES, so the
audit invariants are enforced deterministically rather than left to a model. Re-runnable for
free over cached mentions; source-agnostic (serves YouTube + IG).

Carries NO engagement/resonance signal: ``ProductMention`` has none, and engagement
interpretation is the Judgment-owned Engagement Logic Registry's domain
(``orca/product/shared/engagement_registry/engagement_logic_registry_v0.md``) — whose
weighting method is owner-deferred. This fusion answers only "what did the creator say about
this product," never demand / credibility / independence / Action Ceiling.

Spec: youtube_transcript_product_extraction_spec_v0.md (Pass 2 / CE4) +
ig_reels_transcript_product_extraction_spec_v0.md (reuse).
