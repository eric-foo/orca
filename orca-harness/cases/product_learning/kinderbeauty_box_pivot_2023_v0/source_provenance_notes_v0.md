# Source Provenance Notes — kinderbeauty_box_pivot_2023_v0 (v0)

Capture-side record. This is the **capture-spine deliverable** for the Kinder
Beauty box-economics-pivot backtest case: bounded pre-cutoff Wayback captures
produced by the `archive_org` adapter (`run_source_capture_archive_packet.py`,
`select_snapshot <= cutoff`). Every unit below is `cutoff_posture: pre_cutoff`,
body-verified (served body equals the selected snapshot), `warnings: []`,
`limitations: []`. It is **not** a backtest fixture and asserts no judgment.

## Case context (roster-stated; not independently verified here)

From the consumer-demand candidate pool (candidate #4):

- **Decision being backtested:** Kinder Beauty's beauty-box economics pivot (~March 2023).
- **Cutoff:** 2023-03-01 (every unit selects the latest snapshot at or before this cutoff).
- **Known later outcome:** shutdown January 2024; pre-announcement decay reported by r/BeautyBoxes.

The outcome above is roster-stated context, **not** an independently sealed or
verified outcome record for this case (Beauty Pie / Topicals have sealed records; this case does not yet).

11 body-verified units. Page content is **recorded, not interpreted** — the raw
HTML body is preserved for a later parser/judgment step; what the offer/pricing/
box contents actually were is not asserted here (capture preserves bytes + provenance only).

## Honest coverage limits

- **E9 (`/collections/all`) not captured.** The archive.org CDX endpoint returned
  repeated `503 Service Unavailable` for that URL across two attempts (rate-limited
  during batch capture); it is dropped rather than committed as an empty attempt.
  Other product/collection pages (E10 bestsellers) captured fine.
- **Not archived / not findable on Wayback** (per a bounded discovery sweep):
  pre-cutoff **r/BeautyBoxes thread-level** discussion (the subreddit home is archived,
  but specific Kinder Beauty threads are sparse), **press/news** coverage, a **careers /
  Greenhouse/Lever** board (none found — so no hiring trajectory like Beauty Pie's), and
  an **about/our-story** page.
- **Content not parsed** (INV-1): capture records observed facts + limits and introduces
  no weights, scores, ranks, or judgment.
- **Line endings:** capture raw files commit under repo-wide `autocrlf=true` with no
  `.gitattributes` (matching the existing Beauty Pie / Topicals precedent). The committed
  blobs are byte-faithful (blob sha256 = the manifest sha256 above); a Windows working-copy
  checkout shows CRLF-inflated sizes. Marking `source_captures/** -text` repo-wide is the
  correct fix but would re-touch the frozen Beauty Pie / Topicals fixtures, so it is left as
  an owner-gated hygiene call.

## Non-claims

Not validation, not readiness, not a backtest fixture, not a band input, not a
sealed outcome, not contestant-visible, not Cleaning/ECR/Judgment, not buyer
proof. Product-learning tier, capture-only, N=11 pre-cutoff snapshots.
