"""Driver: run Pass 1 over a transcript and persist the mentions into the Data Lake.

Mirrors `ecr/lake.py` (read/derive/append), adapted for the LLM extractor: take a
TranscriptInput, run `extract_transcript_products`, and append the validated mentions as a
silver derived record-set at
``derived/<transcript_anchor>/silver__cleaning__product_mentions/<record_id>`` with an
all-or-nothing completion marker (so the runner can skip already-extracted transcripts).

Lives in `cleaning/` because it invokes the LLM extractor. Also owns the source->cues
normalizers (ASR derived record / caption json3), so the runner stays a thin orchestrator.
