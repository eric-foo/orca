"""Deterministic employee-count extractor for EDGAR 10-K narrative (Layer-2, slice 04).

A pure, regex-based parser: 10-K Item-1 "Human Capital" narrative text in -> a structured
``EmployeeCountExtraction`` out (the count + value-quality + measurement-basis + the exact
source span). No I/O, no model imports -- fully offline-testable on synthetic snippets.
Extraction is REGEX/text-parsing, NOT an LLM, so the same text + same ``PARSER_VERSION`` /
``RULESET_SHA256`` reproduce the same value (the re-derivability the observation provenance
binds, AR-05).

Honesty (the load-bearing behaviour):
- a clean single reading -> ``found`` with quality ``exact`` | ``approximate``;
- multiple readings with DIFFERENT bases -> the PRIMARY headcount is chosen (``total`` is the
  canonical company figure) and the others are recorded as ``alternates`` -- the AR-03
  one-canonical-observation-per-filing rule, not a competing observation;
- multiple readings TIED at the top basis with conflicting values -> ``ambiguous`` (no single
  trustworthy value);
- no match -> not-found with a reason. Never a guessed number.

CONSERVATIVE ACCEPTANCE (cross-vendor review F-01): a bare "N <employee-noun>" phrase is NOT
enough -- a 10-K states many non-headcount employee counts (hiring/layoff events, regional or
segment subsets, union/benefit-plan counts, generic "people"). The extractor emits a KNOWN count
ONLY when the phrase is in a workforce-TOTAL context: it carries a workforce qualifier / FTE noun,
or a possession/as-of cue (had / employ(ed) / workforce / "as of ...") sits just before it; AND it
is not an event count (an event verb immediately before) AND not a scoped count (a segment/region/
benefit-plan phrase just after). Event / scoped / un-cued phrases are an HONEST MISS, never a
guessed KNOWN -- errors are pushed to the safe (miss) direction. A regex cannot catch every
non-headcount phrasing; the residual is a recorded limitation, not a silent guess.

Basis (cross-vendor review F-02) is read from the MATCHED qualifier + noun, not a pre-count window
scan, so a grammatical "a total of N full-time employees" is ``full_time`` (the qualifier on the
noun), not ``total`` (the "a total of" before the count).

v0 scope also does NOT match the "average number of employees was N" form (number AFTER the noun)
-> an honest not-found. A later ``PARSER_VERSION`` widens coverage; the provenance versions it.

``extraction_to_measure_facts`` bridges an extraction to the observation's honesty-typed measure
fields (``employee_count`` / ``employee_count_int`` / ``value_quality`` / ``measurement_basis``)
so it plugs straight into ``EdgarHeadcountObservation``.
