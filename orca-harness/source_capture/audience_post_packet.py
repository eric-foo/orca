"""Build a SourceCapturePacket from a creator's POST TEXT (Capture layer; network-free).

This is the AUDIENCE-inference input surface ("A4"): a creator's own WRITTEN post
caption + profile bio + identity, staged as a contract-compliant SourceCapturePacket
and persisted to the data lake. It is the input that Pass-1 audience extraction
(`cleaning/audience_extractor.py`) reads as a `PostInput` -- the deterministic,
LLM-free bridge between capture and the audience lane (Slice C, deferred). The
packet -> PostInput adapter lives in the cleaning lane (`cleaning/audience_post_input.py`),
not here, so this capture module imports nothing from cleaning.

Distinct from the transcript spine: a transcript packet carries SPOKEN text (caption
track / ASR); this carries the creator's WRITTEN post text + bio. No transcription, no
LLM. Network-free: it takes an already-fetched `AudiencePostFetch` (the live fetch is
upstream -- YouTube video title+description via the existing watch capture; Instagram
post caption + profile bio), so it is fully unit-testable from a canned fetch -- the
same discipline as `source_capture/transcript/caption_packet.py`, which this mirrors.

Identity is per-platform and object-level: `creator_handle` is the public platform
handle/id, NOT a cross-platform or person identity (honors the medallion contract's
given-up cross-platform-identity limitation).

RESIDUAL: the Instagram profile-bio capture is a separate queued capture-add. An IG
fetch without a bio is still valid (bio is optional), but IG audience signal is thin
without it (the bio is IG's strongest positioning text); a bio-less packet records the
gap as a capture-level limitation.
