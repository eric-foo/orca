# Source Observability Scalability Note

This note records how the local source-observability helper should scale after
the first Slot 3 WSO and Slot 1 M&I/BIWS dry-use passes.

It is a harness-local application note. It is subordinate to the Data Capture
obligation contract, the Data Capture/Cleaning/Judgment boundary, and the
source-observability local support authorization. It does not create product
doctrine, source-access authority, fixture policy, or a required handoff gate.

## Current Evidence Base

The helper has been dry-used against two different pressure-test shapes:

- Slot 3 WSO: forum-like venue evidence with bounded source-language anchors,
  discovery inventory, hidden-comment/gated-access posture, and missing raw
  HTML, screenshots, archive body, full thread graph, hidden comments, and
  exact per-page acquisition evidence.
- Slot 1 M&I/BIWS: non-forum offer/pricing evidence with pricing facts, bundle
  structure, redirected pages, archive-availability posture, layout loss, and
  archive-body access failure.

The same local record model handled both without schema expansion. The evidence
supports keeping the current helper small while adding discipline for future
extension.

## Local Helper Boundary

Source-observability records are operator-authored posture observations about a
capture artifact. They are not extracted source truth.

The helper may help an operator record whether source language, visible source
structure, archive body content, media/layout evidence, access posture,
locator context, cutoff context, and limitation notes are visible.

The helper must not:

- acquire sources;
- retrieve archive bodies;
- preserve media or screenshots;
- automate browsers, scrapers, APIs, crawlers, proxies, or source access;
- decide source quality, credibility, relevance, inclusion, exclusion,
  discounting, Signal Use, Decision Strength, or Action Ceiling;
- define ECR fields, receipt IDs, schemas, storage, or file formats;
- perform Cleaning transformations;
- perform Judgment or synthesis;
- claim capture validation, capture readiness, buyer proof, commercial
  readiness, or source adequacy.

Human posture judgment must remain visible. The helper should expose what the
operator says is preserved, paraphrased, pointer-only, inaccessible, failed,
not attempted, or not applicable.

## Source-Slice Posture Record Discipline

The primary local record unit is a source-slice posture record.

Use one record for one source slice whose posture is uniform enough to inspect:
a page, forum thread group, media-bearing slice, archive posture, access
failure, venue unit, or other bounded source surface.

Do not collapse divergent states into one record when that would hide a
limitation. Split records when locator, archive body, access, cutoff, media,
source-language, or visible-structure posture materially differs.

Examples:

- a current live offer page and a failed archive-body attempt should remain
  distinguishable;
- a public anchor pass and hidden-comment access failure should remain
  distinguishable;
- source-language anchors and pointer-only media should not be rolled into a
  clean combined posture;
- archive availability without archive-body retrieval remains a limitation,
  not historical-source preservation.

Current structured fields are provisional helper fields. They are not promoted
Core Spine invariants, final capture obligations, or ECR schema fields.

Source-family specifics should remain in `source_family` and
`limitation_notes` until repeated pressure justifies a structured helper field
or a product-level decision accepts a specific invariant.

## Report Output Invariants

The report output should preserve:

- emitted limitations;
- `record_summaries`, so each operator posture record remains inspectable next
  to the emitted limitation types;
- `non_claims`, so reports do not read as validation, readiness, ECR receipt,
  Cleaning output, Judgment output, source acquisition, archive retrieval,
  browser automation, or source-quality scoring.

A report with no emitted limitations is not a pass. It only means the supplied
operator records did not expose limitations the helper knows how to flag.

The helper is not a required handoff gate. It can support pressure-test
inspection and operator consistency, but it must not become the condition for
categorical handoff.

## Extension And Promotion Rule

Prefer `limitation_notes` and record splitting before adding fields.

Add a new structured field or limitation type only when one of these is true:

- at least two non-overlapping source families show the same source-observability
  pressure; or
- the owner explicitly signs off on one specific invariant claim.

Owner signoff attaches to the specific invariant, not a broad category such as
"forums", "pricing pages", or "source observability".

Possible future examples include clearer first-class support for
bounded-anchor-only posture, mixed access posture, pointer-only inventory, or
full-comment-graph absence. Those remain candidate helper refinements until
accepted through the extension rule above.

## Forbidden Expansion

Do not use this helper note to authorize or backdoor:

- source-access method planning;
- archive-body retrieval implementation;
- screenshot, media, or multimodal preservation implementation;
- live capture;
- browser automation;
- storage, dashboards, databases, or deployment;
- source-access boundary changes;
- Data Capture obligation-contract hardening;
- ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment design.

If future work needs those capabilities, route it through a separate owner
authorization and the controlling product documents.

## Dry-Run Output Lifecycle

Dry-run outputs are scratch unless a later fixture policy accepts them.

This applies to both:

- operator-authored input YAML; and
- generated report JSON.

The current dry-run path under `orca-harness/reports/source_observability/` is
operator-chosen output, not a blessed durable fixture location.

Do not ignore, delete, move, or bless the whole `orca-harness/reports/`
directory from source-observability cleanup. That directory may contain
live-looking harness files unrelated to these dry-run outputs.

If later cleanup or `.gitignore` work is authorized, target specific dry-run
file patterns, not the entire `orca-harness/reports/` tree. Pattern examples
such as source-observability `*_dry_run.yaml` and `*_dry_run.json` are
illustrative only; the cleanup lane must confirm actual file names before
acting.

If a dry-use case is later promoted to a tracked fixture, the durable fixture
should preserve the operator-record input and regenerate the report
deterministically from it. The generated report may be checked only if a later
fixture policy accepts its location and refresh rule.

The broader untracked `orca-harness/reports/` state is a repo-health issue, not
part of this note's local support scope.

## Non-Claims

This note is not validation, readiness, fixture acceptance, health cleanup
authorization, `.gitignore` policy, file-pattern policy, reports-tree policy,
source-of-truth promotion, source acquisition, archive retrieval, media
preservation, browser automation, ECR receipt, Cleaning output, Judgment
output, source-quality scoring, buyer proof, or commercial-readiness evidence.
