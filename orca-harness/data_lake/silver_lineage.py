"""Generic Silver lineage grammar: build/validate the source-reference fields a
Silver record carries, so a downstream agent can tell source-backed evidence,
derived-record evidence, projection-row evidence, and accepted limitations apart
without inventing per-lane provenance fields.

This is the additive helper/validator from the adjudicated genericity check
(`docs/workflows/silver_lineage_kit_genericity_check_v0.md`). It models REFERENCES,
not media: which raw packet/file/hash a fact came from (`raw_refs`), which exact
prior derived record it consumed (`derived_refs`, with an optional projection
`row_locator`), the source-local identity being observed (`source_object`), and
what lineage is intentionally absent (`lineage_limitations`).

Two adjudicated review findings are load-bearing here and are enforced, not just
documented:

- AR-01 (one home). The Silver Vault Common Record Header
  (`core_spine_v0_data_lake_silver_vault_record_contract_v0.md`) is the single
  persisted home for `raw_refs`/`derived_refs`/`source_surface`/timestamps/producer
  fields. This module is an in-process BUILDER, never a second persisted store:
  ``to_record_fields()`` emits header-shaped TOP-LEVEL fields a writer merges into
  the record in place. It deliberately does NOT emit a nested ``silver_lineage``
  object, so a producer cannot create two homes for the refs.
- AR-02 (projection row identity). ``SilverDerivedRef`` carries an optional
  ``row_locator`` (``row_id``/``row_kind``) mirroring ``CleaningProjectionRef``, so a
  fact derived from one row of a multi-row projection record is not collapsed to
  ``lane + record_id`` alone.

Field names track the genericity check grammar and the Common Record Header
vocabulary: ``kind`` (not ``object_type``, AR-04) for ``source_object``, and inline
``relative_packet_path`` on raw refs (AR-03).

Scope (v0): additive helper + validator + one representative adopter. NOT a
universal record-wrapper migration, NOT a historical lake rewrite, NOT a Silver
Vault schema redesign. Those are accepted residuals in the genericity check.
