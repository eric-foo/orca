"""Deterministic Data Lake touchpoint inventory (the A1 inventory gate core).

Single source for the AST discovery the seam-coverage contract test seeds and
for the durable, checked-in touchpoint inventory record
(``lake_touchpoint_inventory_v0.json``). The record enumerates, from tracked
source only:

1. raw-packet writers (runner seams, declared orchestrators, and the recursive
   ``source_capture`` writer-function closure);
2. non-raw lake touchpoints (derived/ack/silver/catalog call sites);
3. explicit exclusions, each carrying a reason;
4. unknowns, each carrying an owner disposition (a pending unknown fails the
   gate; dispositions are owner-attributable via the human-gated PR merge,
   never self-certified);
5. the A2 serialization-fork impact tag per entry;
6. an ``identity_binding`` declaration per runner seam: how the runner binds
   SERVED content to the REQUESTED subject before a packet is committed
   (``bound`` with a mechanism), or an honest ``unbound``/``not_applicable``
   posture with a reason. Declared in ``RUNNER_IDENTITY_BINDINGS``, never
   auto-discovered; a discovered runner without a declaration fails the gate,
   so the wrong-subject-attribution question (F-01 in
   ``docs/review-outputs/youtube_rss_monitor_delegated_adversarial_code_review_v0.md``)
   is mandatory at build time for every new capture runner. The declaration
   documents the current posture; ``unbound`` is a visible acknowledged gap,
   not a pass.

The fork-impact tag is deterministic routing metadata for the deferred A2
decision (Manifest v2 vs manifest-equivalent packet index), assigned by
surface class, never per-entry judgment:

- raw-packet writers produce packet manifests -> ``manifest_shape``;
- generated catalog / Attachment Record read surfaces consume or rebuild the
  manifest-equivalent generated index -> ``packet_index``;
- derived/ack append and record-set/lane-path surfaces touch neither shape ->
  ``none``.

The checked-in record is a generated inventory of code surfaces. It is never
lake authority, never lives under the data root, and is regenerated and
diffed by ``tests/contract/test_data_lake_inventory_gate.py``; updating it is
a deliberate, reviewed edit. It does not select A2, a backend, or claim
coverage beyond source-visible discovery.
