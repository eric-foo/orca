"""Single source of truth for Data Lake derived-lane roles.

Every derived lane a producer writes has a ROLE here. This is the map the
no-blur write-path guard reads (``.agents/hooks/check_silver_lane_registry.py``):
the guard rejects a ``silver``-named lane that is not declared, and a raw write
to a ``silver_envelope`` lane that bypasses the validating front-door.

Declarative on purpose: this module imports no producer code (it sits in the
base ``data_lake`` layer), so the guard can load it standalone without pulling
the harness or risking an import cycle. Lane string VALUES are mirrored from the
producers' own constants; the guard enforces that mirror (a written silver lane
that is absent here fails CI), so the two cannot silently drift.

Two grammars, declared honestly:

- ``silver_envelope``: the ``silver_vault_record_v0`` record envelope
  (``record_kind``/``payload_kind``/``payload.observation``). The validating
  front-door ``data_lake.silver_record.append_silver_record`` is the only
  sanctioned writer.
- ``silver_lineage``: the SECOND, pre-existing silver grammar -- the
  ``silver_lineage`` kit plus a freeform payload (transcript/IG product mentions
  and the ``silver__capture__*`` set lanes). Batch 1 DECLARES it; it does not
  reshape those records onto the envelope. Reconciling the envelope and
  lineage-kit grammars is a high-lock-in fork deferred to a later batch,
  coordinated with PR #456.

``FRONT_DOOR_PENDING`` records ``silver_envelope`` lanes whose producer has not
yet been migrated onto the front-door, each with the reason. The guard permits a
raw write to a pending lane (a named, justified baseline -- not a silent
exception); a NEW envelope lane is not allowed here and must use the front-door.
