# Orca Harness

Step A rebuild of the v0.14 deterministic judgment harness.

This package is intentionally narrow:

- deterministic mapping and scoring only;
- fixed disk-backed TR/Casetext plumbing fixture only;
- local source-observability support checks only, not source acquisition;
- local dry memorization-probe receipt normalization only, not provider
  execution;
- opt-in raw-API no-tools memorization-probe execution plumbing only, not
  probe authorization;
- append-only scoring results and failure-event logging;
- explicit non-claim boundary: `plumbing works only; not judgment quality`.

The source-observability helper reports visible capture limitations in local
records. It does not fetch sources, retrieve archives, automate browsers, call
APIs, score source quality, validate Data Capture, or authorize downstream ECR,
Cleaning, or Judgment behavior.

## Screening Reads

Use the screening-read entries when a screen orchestrator needs one bounded
public read without creating a Source Capture Packet:

```python
from source_capture.screening_read import ScreeningReadDispatch, ScreeningReadRoute, screening_read

dispatch = ScreeningReadDispatch(screen_id="screen-123", question="one bounded source question")
result = screening_read(
    url="https://old.reddit.com/r/beauty/search?q=moisturizer&restrict_sr=on&sort=new",
    route=ScreeningReadRoute.REDDIT_SCREENING_READ,
    dispatch=dispatch,
)
```

For public pages that need the browser/interstitial rung:

```python
from source_capture.screening_browser_read import screening_browser_read

result = screening_browser_read(url="https://example.com/public-page", dispatch=dispatch)
```

These entries are orchestrator-invoked, public-only, human-rate, and screen-light
only. They do not stage packets, write manifests, return packet paths, touch ECR,
or run as a standing service/crawler/scheduler. Browser screening reads classify
`block_shell` on visible text, not full DOM. Same-shaped listing pages can reuse
`StructuredListingExtractionSpec` and `extract_structured_listing_candidates(...)` for
row-local title/date extraction. Build receipt:
`docs/workflows/screening_read_service_build_receipt_v0.md`; reusable findings:
`docs/workflows/screening_read_reusable_findings_v0.md`.

## Source Capture Packet

Use the source-capture runner when an operator already has local source files
and needs a no-network packet directory with a manifest, preserved raw files,
SHA256 hashes, posture metadata, and a human-readable receipt:

```powershell
python runners/run_source_capture_packet.py --source-family "docs_page" --source-locator "C:\capture\vendor_pricing_page.html" --decision-question "What did the pricing page show before the decision cutoff?" --input-file "C:\capture\vendor_pricing_page.html" --source-publication-or-event "pricing page date visible in local artifact" --cutoff-posture "pre-decision local capture artifact" --access-posture "local_file_only" --archive-history-not-attempted-reason "local CLI does not query archives" --media-modality-not-attempted-reason "local CLI does not retrieve additional media" --output ".\_test_runs\example_source_capture_packet"
```

This first checkpoint is local-file-only. It does not fetch URLs, call APIs,
query archives, automate browsers, preserve additional media, or decide
credibility, inclusion, Signal Use, Decision Strength, Action Ceiling, buyer
proof, or commercial readiness.

Optional metadata flags let the operator carry already-known source timing,
cutoff, archive, media, actor, mode-change, access, and re-capture posture into
the packet. Omitted fields stay visible as unknown, not attempted, or not
applicable rather than disappearing.

For the packet directory shape and receipt details, see
[`docs/source_capture_packet.md`](docs/source_capture_packet.md).
For agent-facing runner selection, stop conditions, and report format, see
[`docs/source_capture_agent_runbook.md`](docs/source_capture_agent_runbook.md).

Build a local Mini God-Tier source-quality report skeleton from an existing
packet after an operator has commissioned a source-quality pass:

```powershell
python runners/run_source_quality_report_skeleton.py --packet ".\_test_runs\example_source_capture_packet" --source-id "SOURCE-ID" --output ".\_test_runs\example_source_quality_skeleton.yaml"
```

The skeleton helper is manifest/metadata-only. It gives conservative
`suggested_result_token` guidance and keeps final source-language anchors,
coverage/drift notes, lifecycle admission, and `mini_god_tier_met` finalization
with the operator. It does not fetch sources, parse source bodies for meaning,
score source quality, admit fixtures, or run Judgment logic.

Build a read-only Source Quality state census from explicit queue rows and
existing packet paths:

```powershell
python runners/run_source_quality_state_assembler.py --queue ".\_test_runs\example_source_quality_queue.yaml" --output ".\_test_runs\example_source_quality_state_census.yaml"
```

The State Assembler surfaces packet existence, manifest inspectability,
report-skeleton state, visible stops, and operator-finalization requirements
per row. It does not discover sources, run capture tools, fetch data, score
source quality, auto-advance queue rows, or finalize `mini_god_tier_met`.

Use the Direct HTTP runner when one ordinary HTTP URL should be captured into
the same packet shape:

```powershell
python runners/run_source_capture_http_packet.py --url "https://example.com/page" --decision-question "What did the page return before the decision cutoff?" --cutoff-posture "pre-cutoff direct HTTP capture requested by operator" --output ".\_test_runs\example_source_capture_http_packet"
```

This runner is still deliberately narrow. It uses stdlib `urllib` only, follows
normal redirects, preserves the raw response body plus provenance-safe response
metadata, and fails visibly on timeout, DNS/TLS failure, empty-body response,
or byte-cap breach. It does not use browser automation, API SDKs, archive
retrieval, media fetching, scraper frameworks, proxy/auth/session injection,
ECR logic, Cleaning, Judgment, buyer proof, or commercial-readiness logic.

Use the Media / Asset runner when an operator already has explicit
source-meaningful asset URLs, such as image or gallery-frame URLs, and wants
them preserved into the same packet shape:

```powershell
python runners/run_source_capture_media_packet.py --asset-url "https://example.com/source-image.png" --decision-question "Which source-meaningful media asset was visible before cutoff?" --cutoff-posture "pre-cutoff explicit asset capture requested by operator" --output ".\_test_runs\example_source_capture_media_packet"
```

This runner is explicit-URL-only. It reuses the Direct HTTP helper, preserves
asset bodies plus provenance-safe metadata, writes mixed-success packets when
at least one asset is preserved, and carries failed assets as visible
limitations. It does not discover assets, parse galleries, parse HTML, recurse
through linked media, run OCR or image analysis, query archives, automate a
browser, call APIs, use scraper frameworks, inject auth/session/proxy behavior,
or perform ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, buyer-proof, or commercial-readiness logic.

Use the Archive.org runner when an operator wants archive availability metadata
and, when available, a selected Wayback snapshot body preserved into the same
packet shape:

```powershell
python runners/run_source_capture_archive_packet.py --url "https://example.com/page" --cutoff-timestamp "20240501000000" --decision-question "What archived source state was visible before cutoff?" --output ".\_test_runs\example_source_capture_archive_packet"
```

This runner distinguishes archive availability from archive-body preservation.
If availability metadata is preserved but no eligible snapshot or retrievable
body is available, the packet keeps that limitation visible. If availability
lookup itself fails and no metadata is preserved, the runner writes no normal
packet. Snapshot body retrieval reuses the Direct HTTP helper. It does not use
browser automation, Archive.org packages, API SDKs, scraper frameworks,
proxy/session behavior, archived-HTML meaning extraction, OCR, ECR, Cleaning,
Judgment, buyer-proof, or commercial-readiness logic.

Use the TikTok SCI admission runner when page-owned TikTok artifacts have
already been captured and need parser/sanitizer enforcement before packet
admission:

```powershell
python runners/run_source_capture_tiktok_video_packet.py --video-id "7629774409762442526" --video-url "https://www.tiktok.com/@funmimonet/video/7629774409762442526" --comment-list-json ".\_test_runs\tiktok_comment_list_sanitized.json" --video-item-json ".\_test_runs\tiktok_video_item_sanitized.json" --subtitle-webvtt ".\_test_runs\tiktok_subtitle.vtt" --output ".\_test_runs\tiktok_video_admission_packet"
```

This runner is the lean code-enforced slice only: it admits sanitized
single-video comment/subtitle/profile-list fields, keeps raw signed URLs,
cookies, tokens, storage-state, and raw response bodies out of the packet, and
prints the complete-lane note on successful runs and in `--help`.
The complete TikTok lane still requires live browser/profile-grid capture,
creator batch cadence, projection bridging, and recon/playbook updates.


Use the Browser Snapshot runner when one supplied URL needs anonymous browser
rendering or screenshot preservation:

Install the optional browser dependency and Chromium browser binary before live
use:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e .[browser]
python -m playwright install chromium
```

```powershell
python runners/run_source_capture_browser_packet.py --url "https://example.com/page" --decision-question "What browser-rendered source was visible before cutoff?" --cutoff-posture "pre-cutoff browser snapshot requested by operator" --output ".\_test_runs\example_source_capture_browser_packet"
```

This runner preserves rendered DOM, visible text, a viewport screenshot, and
browser metadata into the packet shape. It defaults to a fresh anonymous/headless
browser context. For one supplied URL, operators may choose ordinary visible
browser mode (`--headed`), a local Chromium channel such as Chrome or Edge
(`--browser-channel`), and a bounded post-navigation settle delay
(`--settle-seconds`). It does not accept stored sessions, browser profiles,
cookies, credentials, storage-state files, anti-detect behavior, proxy behavior,
CAPTCHA solving, crawling, OCR, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, buyer-proof, or
commercial-readiness logic.

Use the CloakBrowser Snapshot runner when one supplied URL needs anonymous
anti-blocking browser rendering because ordinary Browser Snapshot controls
(`--headed`, `--browser-channel`, `--settle-seconds`) are expected to fail or
have failed:

Install the optional CloakBrowser dependency before live use:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e .[cloakbrowser]
```

```powershell
python runners/run_source_capture_cloakbrowser_packet.py --url "https://example.com/page" --decision-question "What anti-blocking browser-visible source was present before cutoff?" --cutoff-posture "pre-cutoff CloakBrowser snapshot requested by operator" --output ".\_test_runs\example_source_capture_cloakbrowser_packet"
```

This runner preserves rendered DOM, visible text, a viewport screenshot, and
CloakBrowser method-provenance metadata into the packet shape. It uses an
anonymous non-persistent CloakBrowser launch and does not accept stored
sessions, browser profiles, cookies, credentials, storage-state files, proxy
behavior, CAPTCHA solving, crawling, Reddit target discovery, OCR, ECR,
Cleaning, Judgment, buyer-proof, or commercial-readiness logic.

Use the Authenticated Browser Snapshot runner when one supplied URL requires a
permitted manually bootstrapped browser session:

```powershell
python runners/run_source_capture_browser_session_bootstrap.py --login-url "https://example.com/login" --state-label "example-session" --session-mode "free_account_created_session"
python runners/run_source_capture_authenticated_browser_packet.py --url "https://example.com/page" --state-label "example-session" --session-mode "free_account_created_session" --decision-question "What authenticated browser-visible source was present before cutoff?" --cutoff-posture "pre-cutoff authenticated browser snapshot requested by operator" --output ".\_test_runs\example_authenticated_browser_packet"
```

The bootstrap command opens a headed browser for manual login and writes ignored
local Playwright storage-state JSON plus a session-mode metadata sidecar under
`_auth_state/`. The packet runner loads that state into a browser context,
refuses mismatched session-mode declarations, and preserves rendered DOM,
visible text, a viewport screenshot, and metadata. It records session mode and
state label, but never copies, hashes, prints, or preserves storage-state JSON,
sidecar metadata, cookies, tokens, or credentials. It does not automate
passwords, import browser profiles or raw cookies, bypass entitlement, use
anti-detect or proxy behavior, solve CAPTCHA, crawl, run OCR, ECR, Cleaning,
Judgment, buyer-proof, or commercial-readiness logic.

Dry-run packet outputs under `reports/source_capture/` are local review evidence
unless a separate fixture-admission decision says otherwise. They can include
machine-specific `original_path` provenance values and copied raw source files;
do not treat them as canonical fixtures merely because they sit under
`reports/`.

## Fragrance Review Coverage Runner

Use the fragrance review coverage runner when an operator already has saved
Judge.me widget JSON responses and optional PDP HTML for one fragrance product
and needs a no-network focused coverage receipt:

```powershell
python runners/run_fragrance_review_coverage.py --widget-response ".\_test_runs\luckyscent_widget_page_1.json" --pdp-html ".\_test_runs\luckyscent_pdp.html" --product-url "https://www.luckyscent.com/products/example-fragrance" --output ".\_test_runs\fragrance_review_coverage.json" --as-of-date "2026-06-29"
```

The runner preserves source-visible review row metadata, PDP JSON-LD aggregate
rating/count, selected/skipped row ids, rating/month/length/media/verified
counts, and route residuals. Only selected reader rows keep verbatim body text;
skipped rows keep metadata, body hashes, word counts, and skip reasons. Keep
outputs that contain review text in ignored/local paths unless a later lane
authorizes durable review-body storage.

This runner follows the focused review-coverage policy in
`orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_families/retail_pdp/fragrance_purchase_review_focused_coverage_mgt_v0.md`.
It does not fetch network sources, discover products, crawl reviews, create
Source Capture Packets or durable Attachment Records, score review integrity,
label pain/pleasure/sentiment, or run ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, buyer-proof, or
commercial-readiness logic.

## Source Observability Runner

Use the source-observability report runner when an operator has already authored
local posture records and wants a structured list of visible capture
limitations:

```powershell
python runners/run_source_observability_report.py <records.yaml> --output <report.json>
```

The input must be local YAML or JSON containing either a list of
`SourceObservabilityRecord`-compatible records or a mapping with `records`.
Those records are operator-authored observations, not extracted source truth.
The report output is support evidence for reviewing source-language,
source-structure, archive-body, media, access, locator, and cutoff limitations.

The report is not capture validation, capture readiness, categorical ECR
receipt, Cleaning output, Judgment output, source acquisition, archive
retrieval, browser automation, or source-quality scoring. Do not treat it as a
required capture gate or as proof that the underlying capture is complete.

For record-authoring guidance, see
[`docs/source_observability_operator_records.md`](docs/source_observability_operator_records.md).

## Commands

Run tests:

```powershell
python -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider
```

Run the TR/Casetext plumbing fixture from this directory:

```powershell
python -m runners.run_case cases/plumbing/tr_casetext_2023_v0_14
```

The script-style entrypoint is also supported:

```powershell
python runners/run_case.py cases/plumbing/tr_casetext_2023_v0_14
```

If a score already exists for the same `(case_id, run_id, contestant_id)`, the
runner refuses to write a duplicate unless `--allow-duplicate-score` is passed.
Mapping-version mismatches are a separate override:
`--allow-mapping-version-mismatch`.

Build a local dry memorization-probe receipt from pre-supplied probe input and
response files:

```powershell
python runners/run_memorization_probe.py --probe-input <probe_input.yaml> --raw-response <raw_response.yaml> --output <probe_receipt.yaml>
```

This runner does not call a model, provider SDK, browser, network, search, or
participant packet. It only normalizes local inputs into the v0.14
`contestant_execution_isolation` receipt shape and applies local gate
interpretation. A clean gate still requires structural no-tools evidence under
the v0.14 no-tools execution contract; prompt-only "do not search" language is
not enough.

Run an explicitly authorized raw-API no-tools memorization probe:

```powershell
python runners/run_memorization_probe_raw_api.py --probe-input <probe_input.yaml> --output <probe_receipt.yaml> --provider <openai_responses|anthropic_messages> --api-url <provider_url> --api-key-env <ENV_NAME> --allow-live-provider-call
```

The raw-API runner uses no provider SDK and requires the live-call flag so an
operator cannot accidentally call a model while doing local validation. Clean
no-tools isolation is limited to the standard OpenAI Responses endpoint and
Anthropic Messages endpoint named by the runner; arbitrary proxy or provider
URLs are rejected for clean isolation. The runner rejects request bodies with
tool, search, retrieval, browser, file, attachment, workspace, system,
developer, or hidden-context fields, and the receipt `raw_response_hash` covers
the full provider response body. The runner is still only execution plumbing;
using it for a real probe requires separate owner authorization for the exact
model/case pair.

No-case provider smoke tests are also non-gate-clearing. Before passing
`--allow-live-provider-call` for a synthetic smoke test, follow
`../docs/research/judgment-spine/harness/v0_14/no_case_smoke_test_authorization_checklist_v0.md`
and capture the required out-of-band execution provenance. A smoke receipt must
not be cited as a clean memorization-probe pass for any real model/case pair.

## Generated TR/Casetext Scores

The runner writes score files under
`cases/plumbing/tr_casetext_2023_v0_14/scores/` and failure-event logs under
`memory/logs/`. Those paths are local generated outputs and are ignored by git.

If a generated score already exists for the same `(case_id, run_id,
contestant_id)` tuple, the runner refuses to write another score unless
`--allow-duplicate-score` is passed. Commit generated scores only under a
separate fixture-admission decision.
