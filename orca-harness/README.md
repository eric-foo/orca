# Orca Harness

Step A rebuild of the v0.14 deterministic judgment harness.

This package is intentionally narrow:

- deterministic mapping and scoring only;
- fixed disk-backed TR/Casetext plumbing fixture only;
- local source-observability support checks only, not source acquisition;
- local dry memorization-probe receipt normalization only, not provider
  execution;
- opt-in raw-API no-tools memorization-probe execution plumbing only, not
  probe authorization;
- append-only scoring results and failure-event logging;
- explicit non-claim boundary: `plumbing works only; not judgment quality`.

The source-observability helper reports visible capture limitations in local
records. It does not fetch sources, retrieve archives, automate browsers, call
APIs, score source quality, validate Data Capture, or authorize downstream ECR,
Cleaning, or Judgment behavior.

## Source Observability Runner

Use the source-observability report runner when an operator has already authored
local posture records and wants a structured list of visible capture
limitations:

```powershell
python runners/run_source_observability_report.py <records.yaml> --output <report.json>
```

The input must be local YAML or JSON containing either a list of
`SourceObservabilityRecord`-compatible records or a mapping with `records`.
Those records are operator-authored observations, not extracted source truth.
The report output is support evidence for reviewing source-language,
source-structure, archive-body, media, access, locator, and cutoff limitations.

The report is not capture validation, capture readiness, categorical ECR
receipt, Cleaning output, Judgment output, source acquisition, archive
retrieval, browser automation, or source-quality scoring. Do not treat it as a
required capture gate or as proof that the underlying capture is complete.

For record-authoring guidance, see
[`docs/source_observability_operator_records.md`](docs/source_observability_operator_records.md).

## Commands

Run tests:

```powershell
python -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider
```

Run the TR/Casetext plumbing fixture from this directory:

```powershell
python -m runners.run_case cases/plumbing/tr_casetext_2023_v0_14
```

The script-style entrypoint is also supported:

```powershell
python runners/run_case.py cases/plumbing/tr_casetext_2023_v0_14
```

If a score already exists for the same `(case_id, run_id, contestant_id)`, the
runner refuses to write a duplicate unless `--allow-duplicate-score` is passed.
Mapping-version mismatches are a separate override:
`--allow-mapping-version-mismatch`.

Build a local dry memorization-probe receipt from pre-supplied probe input and
response files:

```powershell
python runners/run_memorization_probe.py --probe-input <probe_input.yaml> --raw-response <raw_response.yaml> --output <probe_receipt.yaml>
```

This runner does not call a model, provider SDK, browser, network, search, or
participant packet. It only normalizes local inputs into the v0.14
`contestant_execution_isolation` receipt shape and applies local gate
interpretation. A clean gate still requires structural no-tools evidence under
the v0.14 no-tools execution contract; prompt-only "do not search" language is
not enough.

Run an explicitly authorized raw-API no-tools memorization probe:

```powershell
python runners/run_memorization_probe_raw_api.py --probe-input <probe_input.yaml> --output <probe_receipt.yaml> --provider <openai_responses|anthropic_messages> --api-url <provider_url> --api-key-env <ENV_NAME> --allow-live-provider-call
```

The raw-API runner uses no provider SDK and requires the live-call flag so an
operator cannot accidentally call a model while doing local validation. Clean
no-tools isolation is limited to the standard OpenAI Responses endpoint and
Anthropic Messages endpoint named by the runner; arbitrary proxy or provider
URLs are rejected for clean isolation. The runner rejects request bodies with
tool, search, retrieval, browser, file, attachment, workspace, system,
developer, or hidden-context fields, and the receipt `raw_response_hash` covers
the full provider response body. The runner is still only execution plumbing;
using it for a real probe requires separate owner authorization for the exact
model/case pair.

No-case provider smoke tests are also non-gate-clearing. Before passing
`--allow-live-provider-call` for a synthetic smoke test, follow
`../docs/research/judgment-spine/harness/v0_14/no_case_smoke_test_authorization_checklist_v0.md`
and capture the required out-of-band execution provenance. A smoke receipt must
not be cited as a clean memorization-probe pass for any real model/case pair.

## Generated TR/Casetext Scores

The runner writes score files under
`cases/plumbing/tr_casetext_2023_v0_14/scores/` and failure-event logs under
`memory/logs/`. Those paths are local generated outputs and are ignored by git.

If a generated score already exists for the same `(case_id, run_id,
contestant_id)` tuple, the runner refuses to write another score unless
`--allow-duplicate-score` is passed. Commit generated scores only under a
separate fixture-admission decision.
