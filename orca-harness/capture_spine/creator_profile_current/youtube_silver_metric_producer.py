"""Emit Silver Vault creator-metric records from the committed YouTube Shorts
fragrance creator-metric seed.

This producer makes YouTube creator metrics lake-native. Mirroring the merged
Instagram producer's Silver-envelope discipline
(``silver_metric_producer.py``), it re-emits each committed seed metric
observation and each per-account rollup as a formal Silver Vault derived record
(``record_kind: observation``) conforming to the Silver Vault record contract
(common header, content-hash discipline, posture/value coupling) and to the
sibling ``youtube_creator_metric_silver_record_contract_v0`` doc.

Number source -- resolved in scoping as Option 2 ("wrap the committed seed"):
the producer reads the committed
``youtube_shorts_fragrance_creator_metric_seed_v0.json`` and wraps its
``metric_observations`` + ``metric_rollups`` into Silver envelopes. It does NOT
recompute any metric. No-drift is therefore guaranteed by construction: the
emitted numbers ARE the committed, already-tested seed numbers.

Boundary: this producer does NOT compute metrics, does NOT regenerate the
``creator_profile_current`` read model (that is the separate reader lane), does
NOT introduce cross-platform creator identity, and does NOT write to the real
lake by itself -- callers pass a ``DataLakeRoot`` (tests use
``DataLakeRoot.for_test``); running it against the production lake is an
operational step outside this module.

Scope (v0), mirroring the IG slice:
- emits MetricObservation + MetricRollupObservation observation records only;
- does NOT emit entity or relationship records (the metric subject is carried as
  a self-describing ``entity_key`` reference);
- per-platform account subjects only; no cross-platform creator rollups.

YouTube-specific anchoring (resolved in scoping; an honest divergence from IG):
- Each committed YouTube observation carries its own real raw-packet id in
  ``source_packet_id_or_none`` (a Crockford-26 lake packet handle). Each
  MetricObservation Silver record anchors to that per-Short packet id, exactly
  as IG anchors to its projection packet.
- A per-account rollup's source observations span MULTIPLE distinct per-Short
  packets (28 of 30 accounts), so there is no single source packet to anchor the
  rollup to. The rollup anchors to its ``platform_account_id`` instead -- an
  honest account-scoped raw anchor for a multi-packet aggregate. (IG can share
  one packet across a rollup's observations; YouTube cannot.) Named residual.
- The YouTube seed carries NO IG-style ``raw_anchor`` dict
  (file_id/relative_packet_path/sha256). ``raw_refs`` are rebuilt honestly from
  the YouTube seed's own portable provenance fields (``source_pointer``,
  ``source_field``, ``source_file``, ``source_packet_id_or_none``) plus the
  captured watch/shorts HTML sha256s, which ARE the hash-checkable source
  material per the Silver Vault ``raw_refs`` rule.
- When requested, observation ``raw_refs`` are upgraded through the public Bronze
  source-surface catalog helper for YouTube watch Attachment Records. The join is
  packet id + body hash, because the seed does not carry packet-relative body
  paths; missing or ambiguous AR rows stay visible as lineage limitations.

Accepted residuals (named for review, not hidden):
- Derives from the committed proof seed JSON rather than recomputing from source
  review-inputs -- the doctrinal difference from IG, which reuses a live builder.
  Upgrade trigger: if the YouTube seed needs live recompute, extract a
  ``youtube_metric_seed.py`` builder (handoff Option 1) and have this producer
  reuse it.
- The Silver-envelope helpers (content hash, canonical JSON, posture coupling,
  fail-closed native-id) are duplicated from the IG producer to keep the merged
  IG module untouched. Upgrade trigger: a clean shared silver-envelope core is
  extracted and both producers import it.
- These records share the platform-agnostic ``creator_metric_silver`` /
  ``creator_metric_rollup_silver`` lanes with the IG producer (records stay
  distinguishable by ``source_family``/``source_surface``/subject namespace).
  Upgrade trigger: the owner/reader prefers per-platform lanes -- a constant
  change while records remain test-only (no real-lake migration).
