"""Unit tests for the YouTube creator-metric rollup PRODUCER runner -- the
capture-fed lake-population step (YouTube fold-in / s8 / AR-06) that deposits the
records the snapshot runner's account-anchored discovery consumes.

The core (``run_youtube_producer``) runs against a temp lake from the REAL
committed review-input captures (they are checked into the repo, so CI can drive
the whole capture-fed chain lake-free). There is no real-lake ``main`` test: the
producer is append-only, so running it against the live lake would deposit
durable records -- not something a test may do. ``main``'s only extra surface
over the tested core is ``DataLakeRoot.resolve`` (covered by the lake's own
tests) and ledger loading (covered here).
