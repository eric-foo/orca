"""Mixed-grain composition (I1): the SP-1 / SP-2 / SP-3 / SP-6 derivers read together.

Proves the four source-side derivers compose into one coherent parallel ECR
record over a single packet at mixed grain (SP-1 / SP-6 per-packet; SP-2/SP-3
per-slice). It asserts STRUCTURAL composition only -- each dimension's clears_*
read at its own grain -- and deliberately computes NO aggregate source-side
verdict: combining the dimensions is the frozen JSG-01 conductor's job, not this
record's. The frozen conductor is never imported or exercised here, and nothing
in this file is a JSG-01 readiness claim.
