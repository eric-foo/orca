# Fixture CSB-First Scan Engagement Overclaim

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Research artifact (fixture)
scope: Fixture for the CSB-first scanning artifact checker.
use_when:
  - Testing the checker.

```

## Scan Intake Receipt

```yaml

```

## Broad Scout Return

The bounded `broad_scout_return` checked public buyer-language frontiers,
exact query risk, venue evaluation paths, hidden venue pointers, negatives,
access notes, and current-state route priority. Recommended main deepening:
inspect the official PDP only for preservation pressure and keep forum review
venues as negatives. High engagement proves demand, clears the demand gate, binds the Capture route, and sets final resonance weight.

## CSB Board Intake

Board source: `docs/research/fixture_csb.md`.

Rows consumed as route map: SBR-001 through SBR-003.

## Exact Query Discovery Ledger

| Query ID | Query text | Intent | Result class | Next-route decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EQ-001 | `"Fixture Brand" "Fixture Product" review` | Test buyer-language venue. | negative | Record gap. |
| EQ-002 | `"Fixture Product" stockout` | Test current-state venue. | hidden_venue_pointer | Record HVP-001. |

## Venue Evaluation Move Log

| Move | CSB row(s) | Frontier | Value class | What happened | Stop check |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M01 | SBR-001 | Official PDP | venue_value | Current state observed. | a:no b:no c:no |
| M02 | SBR-002 | Forum query | negative | No readable buyer-origin venue surfaced. | a:no b:branch-close c:no |

## Hidden Venue Pointers

```yaml
hidden_venue_pointer_id: HVP-001
source_move_id: M02
url: https://example.test/fixture-hidden-venue
reason: >
  Public venue worth later inspection, not demand proof.
```

## Observations

```yaml
observation_id: OBS-001
source_move_id: M01
url: https://example.test/fixture-product
retrieval_date: 2026-06-23
short_quote_or_summary: >
  Fixture official PDP had current-state availability.
signal_stage: access_note
claim_it_might_support: preservation pressure only
gate_role: none
independence_hypothesis: owned source only; no independent demand origin
uncertainty_or_limits: fixture text is not buyer-origin support
```

## Negatives And Access Notes

- `NEG-001`: No public buyer-language venue surfaced inside the exact-query cap.
- `ACCESS-001`: One community surface needed an authorized screening read.

## Capture Triage

```yaml
capture_request_id: CR-001
source_scan: fixture_csb_first_scan
candidate_or_observation_ids:
  - OBS-001
urls:
  - url: https://example.test/fixture-product
    venue: Official PDP
    observation_supported: OBS-001
    gate_role: none
what_capture_should_verify: whether current PDP availability needs preservation
decision_window: fixture current-state window
route_binding_state: unknown
screening_evidence_summary: screen-light official PDP availability note
uncertainty_or_access_limits: no packet-grade capture has been run
not_requested:
  - route expansion
  - packet commitment by scanning
  - ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment work
```

## Candidate Decision

```yaml
candidate_decision:
  closeout_state: no_candidate_after_discovery
  independent_origins_seen: []
  reason: >
    Fixture scan has venue value but no gradeable independent buyer-origin
    support.
```

## Closeout

`no_candidate_after_discovery`.
