## Purpose

This note fixes the product-method boundary between Data Capture Spine, Evidence
Candidate Record, Cleaning Spine, Judgment Spine, Decision Artifact, and Outcome
Memory.

It supersedes the older working alias where "Data Spine" meant Evidence Object
Model / Evidence Unit content contract. In this note, the canonical name is Data
Capture Spine: evidence-grade signal acquisition and preservation. Evidence
Candidate Record owns the pre-cleaning captured-signal receipt.

This is not a runtime design. It may define conceptual capture and preservation
responsibilities, but it does not itself authorize schemas, storage, source
APIs, scrapers, adapters, dashboards, automation, scoring engines, clustering
pipelines, memo generators, deck generators, tests, deployment, proof runs, or
feature planning.

## How To Use This Note

Use this note as a boundary check before creating or patching Core Spine, Data
Capture Spine, Evidence Candidate Record, Judgment Spine, Evidence Unit,
source-family, memo, deck, or outcome-memory artifacts.

Ask three questions:

1. Does this proposed work belong to Data Capture Spine, Evidence Candidate Record,
   Cleaning / Provenance & Normalization, Judgment, Artifact, Outcome Memory,
   Satellite, or a deferred runtime lane?
2. Is the work preserving the Data Capture / Evidence Candidate Record / Cleaning
   split, or is it letting capture, receipt, cleaning, and judgment blur
   together?
3. Is the work non-implementation product architecture, or is it smuggling
   runtime source-system design, implementation, source maps, or proof-run
   execution?

For the next Evidence Candidate Record / Evidence Unit prompt, use this note as
a boundary input. Do not treat it as the completed ECR or Evidence Unit design.

## Decision

Data Capture and Cleaning should be split, with Evidence Candidate Record
between them.

The split is product-method, not runtime:

| Layer | Canonical term | Owns | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data Capture Spine | Evidence-grade signal acquisition and preservation | Source-surface discovery, access-path evaluation, capture obligations, raw-signal preservation, capture fidelity, source visibility, source identity, event/capture timing, cutoff/archive posture, and handoff requirements for public/external signals. | Final ECR field schema, storage, IDs, adapters, scraper/API implementation, source truth, cleaning transformations, credibility labels, discounting, Decision Strength, Action Ceiling. |
| Evidence Candidate Record | Pre-cleaning captured-signal receipt | The content/receipt contract for a captured signal entering Cleaning: raw observation, provenance/timing/capture-context obligations, inspectability reference, preservation posture, and handoff state at a categorical level. | Source discovery, source collection operations, runtime storage, cleaning transformations, integrity labels, signal-use classification, decision-use claims. |
| Cleaning Spine | Provenance & Normalization | Non-destructive transformation ledger, normalization, translation, summarization, dedupe mechanics, clustering mechanics, and raw-to-cleaned traceability. | Source acquisition, credibility, discounting effects, integrity labels, exclusion due to judgment, Decision Strength, Action Ceiling. |
| Judgment Spine | Judgment Spine | Signal Integrity, Signal Use Classification, uncertainty, counterevidence, discounting, exclusion, Decision Strength, Action Ceiling. | Capture, source storage, raw transformation history, deck production. |
| Decision Artifact | Reasoning + Communication Artifact | Memo and evidence appendix as reasoning substrate; executive deck as derived communication. | New unsupported claims or claims above Action Ceiling. |
| Outcome Memory | Backtest + Live Outcome Memory | Cutoff-disciplined replay and attribution-tagged live learning. | Calibration or moat claims without leakage and attribution controls. |

The canonical architecture is:

```text
Decision Frame
-> Data Capture Spine: signal discovery, access, capture, preservation, handoff
-> Evidence Candidate Record
-> Cleaning Spine: Provenance & Normalization ledger
-> Judgment Spine overlays
-> Reasoning Artifact: memo + evidence appendix
-> Communication Artifact: derived executive deck
-> Outcome Memory: Backtest Memory + Live Outcome Memory
```

The wrong moves are:

- collapsing Data Capture, Evidence Candidate Record, and Cleaning into one blurry
  contract;
- using Data Capture Spine as an Evidence Object Model alias;
- giving Data Capture Spine runtime meaning too early;
- treating source availability or collection volume as evidence validity;
- letting Cleaning absorb Judgment;
- letting decks drive evidence structure.

## Layer Rules

Decision Frame remains the required starting point. No Data, Evidence Candidate
Record, Cleaning, Judgment, Artifact, or Outcome layer should create
free-floating evidence inventories outside a decision frame.

Data Capture Spine owns evidence-grade acquisition and preservation requirements. It
may say what kinds of source surfaces, capture fidelity, visibility, timing,
archive posture, and preservation obligations Orca must support conceptually.
It must not become a runtime source-system plan, scraper plan, source inventory,
source map, or generic listening platform.

Evidence Candidate Record owns the pre-cleaning captured-signal receipt. This
artifact does not freeze a field architecture; the current IPF Evidence Unit
standard remains the source to cite until the later Evidence Candidate Record /
Evidence Unit consolidation.

Cleaning Spine may record dedupe and clustering mechanics. Once dedupe or
clustering affects independence, credibility, uncertainty, exclusion, Decision
Strength, or Action Ceiling, the effect belongs to Judgment Spine.

Judgment Spine owns inference and decision-use effects. The consultant-loop CA
lane may train inference, build a case backlog, compare solved cases, and
sharpen judgment rubrics. This note reserves the layer boundary; it does not
claim Judgment Spine is trained, validated, accepted, or ready.

Decision Artifact splits into Reasoning Artifact and Communication Artifact.
The memo plus evidence appendix are the reasoning substrate. The executive deck
is derived communication; every material deck claim should trace back to the
memo or appendix and must not exceed the Action Ceiling.

Outcome Memory splits into Backtest Memory and Live Outcome Memory. Backtest
Memory may support internal calibration only when leakage controls hold. Live
Outcome Memory is attribution-degraded by default until an accepted attribution
discharge protocol exists.

## Inclusion State Rule

The Evidence Candidate Record or later Evidence Unit may carry an inclusion or
handoff state, but the reason for that state must be layer-owned.

| State reason type | Owning layer | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capture or preservation blocker | Data Capture Spine | Source inaccessible under allowed boundary, capture fidelity insufficient, archive posture missing, source visibility cannot be established. |
| Receipt/content blocker | Evidence Candidate Record | Raw observation missing, source identity unresolved, event/capture timestamp obligation unmet, inspectability reference absent. |
| Cleaning blocker | Cleaning Spine | Normalization conflict, duplicate cluster unresolved, translation/summarization trace missing. |
| Boundary blocker | Core Boundary Rules / Judgment Spine | Private material, deceptive collection, ordinary-person dossier risk. |
| Integrity exclusion | Judgment Spine | Artificial-amplification risk prevents use, copied/coordinated signal cannot support demand. |
| Decision-use downgrade | Judgment Spine | Signal is useful for attention but weak for demand. |
| Satellite interpretation blocker | Satellite | Costly behavior undefined for the decision family. |

Data Capture Spine and Evidence Candidate Record may record that a source cannot be
inspected or a timestamp is missing. Cleaning may preserve and propagate that
fact. None of those layers may decide that the signal is credible enough,
strong enough, or action-supporting enough; that belongs to Judgment Spine.

## Core Vs Satellite

Core owns market-agnostic evidence accountability:

- Decision Frame requirement;
- Data Capture Spine capture and preservation obligations;
- Evidence Candidate Record / Evidence Unit invariants;
- provenance, timing, visibility, and cutoff discipline;
- transformation ledger semantics;
- Signal Integrity vocabulary and Integrity Effect Rule;
- Signal Use Classification registry shape;
- Decision Strength and Action Ceiling rules;
- memo plus evidence appendix as reasoning substrate;
- executive deck derivation invariant;
- backtest leakage controls;
- public, market-level, non-deceptive boundary rules;
- non-claims.

Satellites own bounded adaptation:

- buyer context, industry constraints, decision owner, and consequence;
- decision-family language, competitor set, source-family relevance, and source
  blind spots;
- source-family access notes and capture feasibility constraints;
- source-family-adapted normalization heuristics;
- costly-behavior examples;
- allowed verb subset within core Action Ceiling rules;
- success criteria, kill criteria, and satellite-specific Signal Use rows;
- communication artifact template and tone.

Satellites adapt context and interpretation. They must not redefine capture
provenance, admissibility, cutoff discipline, preservation discipline,
integrity effects, cleaning traceability, Action Ceilings, memo/appendix
discipline, or non-claims.

## Source-Family Promotion Rule

Source-family rules may exist in satellites before they become core.

Any proposed capture, cleaning, normalization, or interpretation rule must
declare itself as source-invariant core, source-family-adapted satellite, or
unresolved candidate rule.

Empirical source-family heuristics should not be promoted into core until they
survive comparison across at least two non-overlapping source families or an
owner explicitly accepts the exception. This applies to capture-fidelity
heuristics, copied-language thresholds, review-site normalization, forum
thread/comment hierarchy, vendor-managed forum discounts, AI-rewritten-content
suspicion, and similar source-shaped heuristics.

This rule does not require obvious core invariants, such as raw-signal
preservation, raw-claim separation, or non-destructive transformations, to
re-prove themselves across source families.

## Rejected Or Deferred

Rejected:

- unified Data + Cleaning Spine core;
- Data Capture Spine as Evidence Object Model / content-only alias;
- Data Capture Spine as runtime/source-system architecture;
- Cleaning Spine owning credibility, discounting, exclusion, Decision Strength,
  or Action Ceiling;
- source-family-first core;
- decision-family-first top layer;
- deck-driven spine;
- source maps as inventories or collection plans;
- Outcome Memory as moat claim before leakage and attribution controls exist.

Deferred:

- schemas, storage shape, source IDs, source APIs, scrapers, adapters,
  dashboards, automation, scoring engines, clustering pipelines, source-map
  inventories, memo generators, deck generators, software tests,
  implementation planning, and deployment;
- source taxonomy and numeric source-quality rubric;
- final Evidence Candidate Record / Evidence Unit field architecture;
- final memo format and deck back-reference syntax;
- confidence vocabulary beyond Action Ceiling;
- Snapshot Integrity Class enforcement mechanics;
- Live Outcome Memory attribution-discharge protocol.

## Future Work Boundaries

Data Capture Spine setup CA should answer:

- what source surfaces and acquisition modes Orca must be able to reason about;
- what capture fidelity and preservation obligations are core;
- how cutoff, archive posture, source visibility, and capture context should be
  handled conceptually;
- what Data Capture Spine must hand to Evidence Candidate Record categorically, without
  defining ECR fields or schemas;
- what capture capabilities are core, satellite, rejected, or deferred.

Judgment Spine lane:

- may produce inference-training cases, case backlog, solved-case comparisons,
  judgment rubric refinements, and examples of discounting, exclusion, and
  Action Ceiling decisions;
- should patch accepted judgment rules into the appropriate Judgment Spine or
  Core Spine artifact;
- must not move judgment ownership into Cleaning.

Future Evidence Candidate Record / Evidence Unit consolidation should answer:

- whether Evidence Candidate Record is the final canonical object name or a
  working owner-selected name;
- which Evidence Unit fields are frozen core invariants;
- how capture handoff obligations become receipt fields without turning Data
  Spine into an ECR schema;
- how transformation ledger references should be represented conceptually;
- how inclusion state, state reason, and layer ownership should be recorded;
- how snapshot/archive status relates to pre-cutoff visibility;
- how Judgment overlays attach without becoming raw transformation history;
- what must remain satellite-specific.

## Owner Decisions Remaining

- Whether Evidence Candidate Record is the final canonical object name or a
  working name for the next consolidation.
- Whether Snapshot Integrity Class becomes a core field, optional field, or
  later extension.
- Whether Reasoning Artifact / Communication Artifact split is accepted.
- Whether Backtest Memory / Live Outcome Memory split is accepted.
- Whether Live Outcome Memory can ever carry moat or calibration weight, and
  under what attribution-discharge protocol.
- Whether the two-source-family promotion bar is accepted for empirical
  source-family heuristics.
- Final source taxonomy and source-quality rubric.
- Final Evidence Candidate Record / Evidence Unit field architecture.
- Final memo format and deck back-reference syntax.
- Confidence vocabulary beyond Action Ceiling.
- Backtest case-selection policy.
- Satellite costly-behavior catalog policy.
- Engagement Logic Registry extension model for satellites.
- When, if ever, runtime/source-system Data Capture Spine planning becomes
  authorized.

## Non-Claims

This artifact does not claim buyer validation, willingness-to-pay, repeatability
proof, product readiness, feature readiness, implementation readiness,
commercial readiness, Core Spine validation, Judgment Spine validation,
Evidence Candidate Record completion, or Evidence Unit design completion.

It does not authorize implementation, runtime design, source maps, schemas,
scrapers, automation, tests, deployment, commits, pushes, PRs, proof runs, or
feature planning.

## Current Verdict

Current verdict: `NEEDS_FOUNDATION_ACCEPTANCE`.

This artifact is a proposed product architecture boundary note. It supports
later Data Capture Spine setup, Judgment Spine, and Evidence Candidate Record /
Evidence Unit work while preserving the non-implementation Core Spine boundary.
