# Data Capture Spine Pressure-Test Execution Authorization v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Owner decision artifact
scope: Authorizes one bounded batch of three Data Capture pressure-test captures against the accepted intake-surface target and commissioning plan.
use_when:
  - Checking whether the first bounded Data Capture pressure-test batch may be executed.
  - Checking the exact capture boundary for the three authorized pressure-test slots.
  - Routing post-execution synthesis requirements and non-authorized adjacent work.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only

stale_if:
  - A later owner decision narrows, pauses, or supersedes this execution authorization.
  - The accepted intake-surface target or commissioning plan is materially amended or superseded before the three authorized captures are executed.
  - Pressure-test evidence triggers a pause or re-architecture review that supersedes this batch authorization.

## Status And Owner Decision

Status: `AUTHORIZED_BOUNDED_DATA_CAPTURE_PRESSURE_TEST_EXECUTION_V0`.

Owner decision: `AUTHORIZE_BOUNDED_DATA_CAPTURE_PRESSURE_TEST_EXECUTION`.

Bounded pressure-test execution is authorized against the accepted intake-surface
target in `docs/product/data_capture_spine_intake_surface_consolidation_v0.md`
and the batch plan in
`docs/product/data_capture_spine_pressure_test_commissioning_plan_v0.md`.

This is not validation, not readiness, not pressure-test discharge, not final
contract hardening, and not runtime/tooling authorization.

## Authorized Target

Accepted bounded pressure-test target:

- `docs/product/data_capture_spine_intake_surface_consolidation_v0.md`

Authorized batch plan:

- `docs/product/data_capture_spine_pressure_test_commissioning_plan_v0.md`

Controlling support:

- `docs/product/data_capture_harness_operating_model_architecture_v2_acceptance_decision_v0.md`
- `docs/product/data_capture_harness_operating_model_architecture_v2.md`
- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_obligation_contract_v0.md`

This authorization is bounded to those sources. It does not authorize a broader
Capture Spine contract, runtime plan, or adjacent system design.

## Authorized Batch

The authorized batch is exactly these three slots:

1. Slot 1: Mergers & Inquisitions pricing/product/bundle posture across a 12-24 month window.
2. Slot 2: Teal public docs/pricing/features/recent change history across ~12 months.
3. Slot 3: Non-target US-domestic candidate forum/review discourse on resume-driven interview-getting pain, primary venues Reddit and Wall Street Oasis, cutoff Q2 2026.

If a slot cannot be captured within boundary, it must record a visible stop or
visible blocker. Capture must not invent, widen, or substitute a frame to keep
the batch count at three.

## Authorized Capture Activities

Authorized activities are limited to:

- human-led source capture inside the current source-access boundary;
- agent-assisted source capture within the current obligation-contract
  allow/forbid line;
- structured access only when it stays discoverable-or-entitled, permits free or
  account-created access, remains disclosable, avoids use of obvious
  cross-account/private/admin spillover once noticed, and avoids hard-stop
  access paths;
- archive/history lookup only when the access path is disclosable and stays
  inside the current source-access boundary;
- Mechanical Source Projection only as a Data Capture-owned projection helper.

This authorization does not extend to runtime systems, automated extraction
builds, source-system planning, or capture tooling beyond bounded public-source
execution of the three named slots.

## Required Per-Capture Output

Each authorized capture must produce the commissioning plan's capture-session
Markdown artifact shape with these sections:

- `Decision Frame`
- `Source Boundary`
- `Capture Mode`
- `Per-Obligation Discharge States` for all 16 obligations
- `Per-Slice Posture`
- `Raw Observable Pointers`
- `Failures, Blockers, and Limitations`
- `Agent-Assistance Context`
- `Categorical Handoff Or Visible Stop`
- `LLM Capture-Visibility Checker Output`

All 16 obligation rows must declare one of `met`, `partial`,
`assessed_not_met`, `cannot_assess`, `access_failed`, `blocked`,
`unavailable_by_source`, `not_applicable`, or `not_attempted`. Blank
obligation cells are forbidden. Every non-`met` obligation state must carry a
visible reason.

## Mechanical Source Projection Boundary

Mechanical Source Projection may remove source-envelope noise from a working
view.

Mechanical Source Projection must not remove evidence rows because they look
low-value, repetitive, deleted, bot-like, low-score, embarrassing, or
unhelpful.

Mechanical Source Projection does not certify Cleaning, normalization,
credibility, relevance, or downstream use.

## Stop And Pause Conditions

Stop or mark blocked when:

- source access requires no-entitlement gate bypass, stolen credentials/cookies,
  nonconsensual sessions, security exploits, malware, credential stuffing,
  use of obvious cross-account/private/admin spillover once noticed,
  private/confidential account areas without consent, methods Orca would refuse
  to disclose internally, or otherwise clearly illegal / morally compromising
  methods;
- the capture cannot preserve enough raw observable context for downstream
  inspection;
- a slot cannot be executed inside the authorized discoverable-or-entitled,
  free/account-created, disclosable, obvious-spillover-avoiding,
  hard-stop-avoiding source boundary.

Pause the batch or route for owner review when:

- Capture drifts into ECR schema, Cleaning, Judgment, source-quality scoring,
  or runtime design;
- repeated same-obligation stop conditions appear across captures.

Carry forward the commissioning plan's threshold logic:

- `1 of 3`: patchable unless the failure is unambiguous and severe in itself;
- `2 of 3`: architecture-threatening signal and pause before further pressure
  tests;
- `3 of 3`: architecture-threatening confirmed and v2 controlling status yields
  per the re-architecture trigger clause.

## Post-Execution Gate

After execution, a pressure-test evidence synthesis is required before the
obligation contract is hardened.

That synthesis must classify findings as `patchable` or
`architecture-threatening`.

No contract hardening, no source-family promotion, and no downstream doctrine
promotion occurs inside this execution authorization.

## Explicit Non-Authorization

This artifact does not authorize:

- runtime or source-system planning;
- scrapers, APIs, dashboards, storage, schemas, tests, packages, deployment,
  commits, pushes, or PRs;
- ECR field design;
- Cleaning implementation;
- Judgment rules;
- buyer proof or commercial-readiness claims;
- a final Capture Spine contract.
