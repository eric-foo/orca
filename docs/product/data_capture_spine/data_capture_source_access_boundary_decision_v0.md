# Data Capture Source-Access Boundary Decision v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Product artifact
scope: Records the owner-decided loosening of the Data Capture source-access posture under Obligation 2 (Boundary Compliance) of the obligation contract, to a discoverable-or-entitled + disclosable standard that permits aggressive anti-blocking techniques and materiality-gated provenance cleanup.
use_when:
  - Evaluating whether a source-access / fetch method is in-bounds for Orca Data Capture.
  - Planning source-access tooling or method selection.
  - Checking the current interpretation of Obligation 2 (Boundary Compliance).
  - Checking when authenticated, paywalled, cached, mirrored, or convenience access is in-bounds.

## Status And Decision

Status: `ACCEPTED_SOURCE_ACCESS_BOUNDARY_DECISION_V0`, amended 2026-05-30.

Primary decision: `LOOSEN_SOURCE_ACCESS_TO_DISCOVERABLE_OR_ENTITLED_DISCLOSABLE`.

Owner decision recorded 2026-05-28: loosen Data Capture source access to
permit disclosable aggressive anti-blocking techniques. The 2026-05-30 owner
amendment below supersedes the earlier narrower gated-access line.

This decision is the controlling interpretation of Obligation 2 (Boundary Compliance) for source-access methods. The obligation contract now cross-references this decision as the controlling boundary basis. Where this decision and the contract's Obligation 2 prose appear to differ, this decision controls for source-access method selection until amended or superseded.

Owner amendment recorded 2026-05-30:

```text
Owner decision: maximize source access and avoid over-restraining capture.

For Data Capture discovery, if a source can be found through non-exploit web,
search, archive, API, browser, or similar source paths, treat it as non-private
unless a hard-stop indicator is visible. Free or account-created access is
okay. Entitled paid, client, or consenting-coworker access is allowed. If access
visibly spills into cross-account, private, or admin material, do not use that
spillover once noticed. Fast convenience paths may be used for discovery; if
Judgment later relies on the material, it must be reacquired or verified through
a normal disclosable or entitlement-clean path before final client-facing or
durable evidence use.

The hard stops are explicitly illegal or too morally compromising methods:
stolen credentials or cookies, nonconsensual sessions, security exploits,
malware, credential stuffing, no-entitlement gate bypass, using obvious
cross-account/private/admin spillover once noticed, private or confidential
account areas without consent, or any method Orca would refuse to disclose
internally.
```

## The Standard

A source-access method is **in-bounds** for Orca Data Capture if it acquires **discoverable or legitimately entitled source material** and Orca would **fully disclose how it was obtained**. Orca's accepted posture is intentionally permissive: the risk of over-restraining capture is higher than the risk of using broad disclosable discovery paths.

Operationally, a method is in-bounds when **all** hold:

1. The material is **discoverable through non-exploit source paths**, visible through **free / account-created access**, or visible through **entitled paid, client, or consenting-coworker access**.
2. Obvious cross-account, private, or admin spillover is not used once noticed.
3. Orca would **disclose exactly how the data was obtained** if asked — no method Orca would need to conceal.
4. The method avoids the hard stops below.

**This permits:** scraping of public or discoverable pages; free or account-created login access; entitled paid, client, or consenting-coworker access; JS-rendering headless browsers; rate-limited or aggressive fetching; official or sanctioned APIs; archive/cache/mirror access; logged-in capture or browser automation; convenience shortcuts for discovery; **and anti-blocking techniques — anti-detect / "cloaked" browsers, user-agent and fingerprint configuration, residential or rotating proxies, and CAPTCHA / JS-challenge handling — used to reach source material inside this boundary.**

**This still excludes (hard line, not risk-tolerance):** stolen credentials or cookies; nonconsensual sessions; security exploits; malware; credential stuffing; no-entitlement gate bypass; using obvious cross-account/private/admin spillover once noticed; accessing private messages, private groups, confidential docs, or personal account areas without consent; and any method Orca would refuse to disclose internally. These are out because they are explicitly illegal, internally non-disclosable, or too morally compromising for Orca's trust story.

**Owner-accepted risk posture:** the permitted anti-blocking techniques carry real Terms-of-Service, reputational, and (for actively-enforcing sources such as Reddit) litigation risk. The owner accepts this risk as a deliberate, disclosable posture. This is not a claim of legal sufficiency; obtain real legal counsel before commercializing a scraping-based capability.

## Discovery, Materiality, And Provenance

Fast discovery and evidence-grade provenance are separate.

Discovery / harvest output may be broad, fast, and convenience-oriented. It may enumerate, route, inspect, and preserve candidate source material without immediately proving final evidence-grade provenance.

Discovery output becomes **material** only when Judgment relies on it: citing it, changing confidence, changing Action Ceiling or Decision Strength, using it in a decision claim, or including it in a client-facing or durable corpus output. Mere capture, storage, search-result presence, routing inspection, or queueing is not material use.

When discovery output becomes material, Orca must reacquire or verify it through a normal disclosable path or an entitlement-clean path before final client-facing or durable evidence use. If clean reacquisition or verification is not possible, the limitation must travel visibly and downstream Judgment decides whether the material can be used, discounted, or excluded.

## Free, Account-Created, And Entitled Surfaces

Free login or account-created access is allowed. Paid, client, or consenting-coworker access is allowed. If we do not know access is spilling into cross-account, private, or admin material, we proceed. Once obvious spillover is noticed, that spillover is not used.

In-bounds examples:

- Anyone can create a free account and view the material.
- Orca, the client, or a consenting coworker/collaborator can legitimately log in and view the material.
- A headless browser, automated Chrome session, API, export, cache, or faster endpoint reaches the material for discovery.
- A cached or mirrored copy helps discover the material, and material use is later verified through the normal or entitled path.

Out-of-bounds examples:

- Someone's cookie, session, credential, account, or device is used without consent.
- A no-entitlement gate is deliberately bypassed.
- Obvious cross-account, private, or admin spillover appears; that spillover is not used once noticed.

## Why Discoverable-Or-Entitled + Disclosable Is The Line

The bar is now three things: the material is discoverable, free/account-created, or entitled; the method is disclosable; and hard stops are avoided. Disclosability keeps the trust story intact — Orca can tell a buyer exactly how every source was obtained — the opposite of hiding. The discoverable-or-entitled rule avoids treating every weak gate, cache, bot block, or account surface as a stop condition.

The hard line is not "auth/paywall/private" as a blanket label. The hard line is stolen or nonconsensual access, exploit-style access, no-entitlement gate bypass, using obvious cross-account/private/admin spillover once noticed, internal non-disclosure, or clearly illegal / morally compromising conduct.

This is a deliberate loosening from a stricter reading, recorded as a decision because it amends an accepted-baseline obligation foundational to the trust story. The owner has accepted the associated ToS / reputational / litigation risk of the permitted methods.

## What This Decision Does NOT Do

- It does **not** authorize building source-access tooling, scrapers, crawlers, runtime systems, or any software by itself. Building requires a separate, explicit owner authorization naming the bounded implementation scope.
- Later owner authorization now exists for the bounded first-tranche Source Capture Armory build in `docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_access_tooling_build_authorization_v0.md`; this boundary decision still controls the source-access standard and hard stops.
- It does **not** authorize accessing any specific source; each method/source pair must still pass the standard.
- It does **not** claim legal sufficiency; Orca should obtain real legal counsel before commercializing a scraping-based capability.
- It does **not** waive the other 15 obligations or any non-claim.

## Non-Claims

This artifact does not claim: implementation authorization, runtime authorization, tooling authorization, legal sufficiency, data-rights sufficiency, validation, hardening, readiness, buyer proof, or source-of-truth promotion beyond this decision. It does not authorize commits, pushes, PRs, installs, or builds.

## Next Authorized Step

Use this decision as the controlling boundary basis for Obligation 2 and source-access method planning. Building any source-access tooling still requires separate explicit owner authorization naming the bounded implementation scope; the current first-tranche authorization is `docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_access_tooling_build_authorization_v0.md`.
