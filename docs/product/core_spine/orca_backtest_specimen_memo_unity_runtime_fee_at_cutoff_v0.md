## Internal-Only Boundary

This is an internal Orca backtest specimen only. It is not buyer-facing, not a client memo, not a sales artifact, not a product, not outcome calibration, and not validation or readiness evidence.

This memo is written as if at `2023-09-11 23:59 Pacific Time`. It uses only the sealed Phase 0 + Phase 1 source packet identified in the retrieval header. It does not include or rely on any later outcome fact.

## Decision Frame

Decision question: Should Unity proceed with a broad runtime/install-based fee model, narrow or phase the change, grandfather existing users, change messaging, or hold pending further evidence?

Assumed decision-owner role type: executive or senior monetization/package decision owner accountable for product packaging, developer trust, revenue, customer retention, and launch risk.

Decision family: pricing / packaging / monetization.

Cutoff: `2023-09-11 23:59 Pacific Time`.

Known at cutoff from the sealed source packet:

- Unity has distinct Create and Grow monetization surfaces, so an install/runtime fee would touch the boundary between creation tooling, runtime/distribution use, and monetization economics. Evidence: EU-01, EU-03.
- Unity had visible financial pressure: revenue growth alongside substantial losses and operating expenses above annual revenue. Evidence: EU-02.
- Unity had a material high-value customer base, but the packet does not show which cohorts would face the fee or how enterprise contracts constrain changes. Evidence: EU-04.
- Unity publicly disclosed customer renewal, retention, confidence, competition, price, and customer-economics risks. Evidence: EU-05, EU-06.
- A major alternative engine publicly presented a different licensing frame, making market expectations relevant but not determinative. Evidence: EU-07.
- Exact pre-cutoff Unity pricing pages, plan thresholds, legal terms, elasticity, launch readiness, and acceptance evidence were not established in the packet. Evidence: EU-08 and Evidence Gaps.

Not proven at cutoff:

- Private revenue target, fee mechanics, customer-level exposure, install/runtime usage distribution, elasticity, legal enforceability, enterprise amendment rights, developer switching behavior, buyer acceptance, communications readiness, metering readiness, support readiness, or launch readiness.

## Executive Recommendation

Recommended action ceiling: Do not proceed with a broad runtime/install-based fee model at cutoff. Proceed only with a narrowed, phased, and explicitly grandfathered monetization path, paired with segment exemptions, customer testing, and revised messaging before any broad launch.

Recommended now:

- Hold the broad model.
- Narrow any fee exposure to clearly defined high-value segments where contract rights, economics, and customer communication are understood.
- Phase rollout behind customer testing and operational readiness checks.
- Grandfather existing users or existing projects unless legal, contract, and customer-readback evidence supports a narrower exception.
- Exempt low-revenue or vulnerable segments unless data proves the revenue upside outweighs trust and ecosystem risk.
- Reframe messaging around predictable customer economics and product value, not only Unity revenue capture.

Could become viable if:

- Unity can prove segment-level revenue upside, elasticity, legal/contract enforceability, customer acceptance, metering reliability, support readiness, and communications readiness before launch.

Confidence: moderate. The evidence is strong enough to reject a broad immediate action ceiling, but not strong enough to prescribe the exact fee design.

## Why This Recommendation

First-order evidence:

- Unity's own filing shows the business spans Create and Grow, making a runtime/install charge a cross-surface monetization decision rather than a simple price increase. EU-01, EU-03.
- Unity's own filing shows financial pressure that could justify exploring monetization expansion. EU-02.
- Unity's own filing also flags customer confidence, renewal, cancellation, reduced use, in-house alternatives, competition, price, and customer economics as risk categories. EU-05, EU-06.
- Unity disclosed material high-value customer concentration, supporting segmentation analysis but not proving broad applicability. EU-04.

Second-order interpretation:

- A broad runtime/install fee could create revenue upside, but the packet does not prove the necessary customer-level facts to launch broadly: who pays, how much, under which contract rights, with what elasticity, and with what operational dispute process.
- The strongest support is for a segmented monetization review, not a broad immediate model. High-value customer concentration makes segmentation plausible; missing plan, terms, contract, and elasticity evidence makes broad rollout unsafe.
- Competitive and customer-economics evidence means the decision should be judged by total perceived developer economics, not only Unity's need for revenue.

Key risks:

- Trust risk: Unity's own risk disclosures make customer confidence and renewal relevant. A monetization change tied to runtime or installs could alter expectations about the Create relationship. EU-05.
- Switching/substitution risk: Unity disclosed competition from alternatives and in-house tools; market context shows at least one major alternative engine publicly framed licensing differently. EU-06, EU-07.
- Enterprise packaging risk: high-value customers matter, but the packet does not prove contract rights, grandfathering cost, or segment-specific exposure. EU-04.
- Legal/terms risk: exact pre-cutoff Unity terms and enforceability were not established. EU-08.
- Revenue risk: visible losses support monetization exploration, but not an untested broad rollout. EU-02.

Why broader/faster action is unsafe at cutoff:

- The packet has first-order evidence of motivation and risk, but not first-order evidence that a broad runtime/install model is acceptable, enforceable, measurable, or economically efficient by segment.
- The decision has asymmetric failure modes: a broad fee can affect trust and customer economics across Create users, while the packet only supports targeted monetization exploration.

## Options Table

| Option | At-cutoff assessment | Evidence support | Main risk | Action ceiling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Broad runtime/install fee | Not supported for immediate launch | Financial pressure and cross-surface monetization need exist, but customer economics, terms, and elasticity are unknown. EU-01, EU-02, EU-03, EU-08 | Trust, switching, legal, communications, and customer-economics risk | Hold |
| Narrower segment-specific fee | Plausible if limited to well-understood high-value segments | High-value customer concentration supports segmentation analysis. EU-04 | Contract constraints and customer acceptance unknown | Proceed only under named evidence conditions |
| Phased rollout | Stronger than broad launch | Risk disclosures support controlling rollout exposure. EU-05, EU-06 | May delay revenue and still fail if testing is weak | Phase |
| Grandfather existing users | Recommended default | Packet lacks proof that existing contracts/projects can absorb a changed runtime/install burden | Foregone revenue and package complexity | Grandfather unless contrary evidence is proven |
| Exempt low-revenue or vulnerable segments | Recommended default | Packet does not prove low-segment economics or elasticity; competitive context matters. EU-06, EU-07, EU-08 | Exemptions may narrow revenue base | Exempt pending segment data |
| Messaging/positioning-first approach | Necessary but insufficient alone | Customer confidence and customer economics are known risk categories. EU-05, EU-06 | Messaging cannot solve bad economics or weak terms | Message after design and evidence gates |
| Hold pending more evidence | Supported for broad model | Missing evidence is material to launch safety. EU-08 and Evidence Gaps | Revenue opportunity delayed | Hold broad launch; continue narrowed evidence work |

## Risk Register

| Risk | At-cutoff signal | Severity for broad launch | Mitigation implied by action ceiling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pricing risk | Price and customer economics are disclosed competitive factors. EU-06 | High | Segment, test elasticity, and define predictable economics before launch |
| Trust risk | Customer confidence, renewal, cancellation, and reduced-use risks are disclosed. EU-05 | High | Grandfather, phase, and message around customer predictability |
| Developer ecosystem risk | Create users depend on tooling and runtime expectations; exact acceptance is not proven. EU-01, EU-08 | High | Exempt vulnerable segments and test before broad rollout |
| Switching/substitution risk | Unity disclosed alternatives and in-house tools; competitor licensing context exists. EU-06, EU-07 | Medium-high | Avoid broad surprise changes; compare total economics by segment |
| Enterprise packaging risk | High-value customers are material, but contract constraints are unknown. EU-04 | High | Limit to accounts with known contract rights and readback |
| Legal/terms risk | Exact pre-cutoff Unity pricing and terms visibility was not established. EU-08 | High | Obtain legal/terms analysis before fee exposure |
| Communications risk | Customer confidence is a disclosed risk category; messaging readiness is a packet gap. EU-05 | High | Reframe, test, and prepare support/dispute handling before launch |
| Revenue risk | Financial pressure supports monetization exploration, but revenue capture is unproven by segment. EU-02, EU-04 | Medium | Keep monetization work active, but gate broad launch on economics |

## Evidence Appendix

- EU-01, first-order: Unity has distinct Create and Grow monetization surfaces. Limit: no planned pricing change, fee structure, private rationale, or customer willingness proven.
- EU-02, first-order: Unity had visible financial pressure before cutoff. Limit: no cash need, board pressure, target revenue, acceptable mechanism, or timing proven.
- EU-03, first-order: Unity revenue depended on both Create and Grow businesses. Limit: no revenue by cohort, game size, install count, platform, plan, or developer economics.
- EU-04, first-order: High-value customer base was material. Limit: no proof of which customers would face a runtime/install fee, contract constraints, or exposed churn.
- EU-05, first-order: Renewal, retention, customer-confidence, cancellation, reduced-use, and in-house alternative risks were disclosed. Limit: no quantification of churn, elasticity, switching cost, or fee-specific effect.
- EU-06, first-order: Price and customer economics were public competitive factors. Limit: no competitor adoption likelihood, switching threshold, or acceptable communications package.
- EU-07, contextual: A major alternative engine publicly presented a different licensing frame. Limit: competitor context only; no proof of Unity customer switching, Unity pricing feasibility, or legal constraints.
- EU-08, second-order: Exact pre-cutoff Unity pricing/terms visibility was not established in the source packet. Limit: negative archive lookup results do not prove the evidence did not exist; they only bound this run.

## What Would Change The Recommendation

The action ceiling could move from hold/narrow/phase toward broader launch only if Unity had clean evidence showing:

- real elasticity or revenue sensitivity by customer segment.
- segment-specific install/runtime usage distribution and fee exposure.
- developer churn and switching evidence under the proposed model.
- enterprise contract constraints, amendment rights, notice obligations, and grandfathering cost.
- legal/terms analysis supporting enforceability and dispute handling.
- customer acceptance of grandfathering, exemptions, and fee mechanics.
- launch communication readiness, including support and escalation paths.
- metering, billing, dispute, fraud, and platform-readiness evidence.
- proof that low-revenue or vulnerable segments are either unaffected or protected.

Evidence that would strengthen a hold recommendation:

- high expected churn, weak enforceability, unmeasurable installs, customer rejection in readbacks, inability to grandfather, or communications/support unreadiness.
