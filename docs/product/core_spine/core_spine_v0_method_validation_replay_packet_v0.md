# Core Spine v0 Method Validation Replay Packet v0

## 1. Status, Scope, Source Basis, And Non-Authority

Status: `PACKET_SYNTHESIZED_FROM_ACCEPTED_COMPACT_RECEIPTS`

Scope: Orca Core Spine v0 method-validation replay Phase 6 only: cross-case packet synthesis from sealed case receipts.

Source basis:

- Base packet contract: `docs/prompts/product-planning/core_spine_v0_method_validation_replay_packet_prompt_v0.md`.
- Fresh replay wrapper boundary: `docs/prompts/wrappers/core_spine_v0_method_validation_fresh_replay_source_loading_wrapper_v0.md`.
- Accepted compact receipts supplied for `MV-01`, `MV-03`, `MV-04`, `MV-05`, and `MV-09`.
- Case artifact paths, SHA256 hashes, verdicts, packet summaries, leakage notes, and stated boundaries from those receipts.
- MV-05 is from the accepted clean Phase 4B rerun; the failed Phase 4 MV-05 output was archived under `docs/_inbox/contaminated_method_validation_replay_outputs_2026_05_21_phase4_mv05_compaction/` and was not used as evidence.

Source exclusions for this packet:

- No public web sources were opened.
- No archived contaminated outputs were read.
- No full case artifact bodies were read.
- No source-map construction, broad confidence gathering, or source rereading was performed.

Non-authority: this packet is a synthesis artifact only. It does not validate Core Spine v0, accept the method, accept the case artifacts as independently reviewed, prove buyer demand, authorize feature planning, authorize implementation, or authorize commercial readiness claims.

## 2. Repository State Checked

Workspace checked: `C:\Users\vmon7\Desktop\projects\orca`.

Repository state before packet write:

- Branch state: `main...origin/main [ahead 11]`.
- HEAD checked from recent log: `3bf5c45 docs: add first proof run packet`.
- Dirty state: modified and untracked files were present before this packet was written.
- Target packet path did not exist before write, so no `BLOCKED_OUTPUT_DESTINATION_COLLISION` stop applied.
- Untracked contaminated-output inbox folders were visible in repository status, but their contents were not opened or used.

## 4. Cross-Case First-Order Versus Second-Order Movement

First-order evidence was useful in all five cases for establishing visible pressure, strategic direction, or category movement before cutoff. It did not, by itself, justify broad `Move` or `Commit` recommendations.

Second-order evidence changed the valid decision shape in every case:

- `MV-01`: `Reframe`.
- `MV-03`: `Upgrade + Reframe`.
- `MV-04`: `Downgrade + Reframe`.
- `MV-05`: `Downgrade + Reframe`.
- `MV-09`: `Upgrade + Reframe`.

The cross-case method signal is not that second-order evidence always raises confidence. Its stronger signal is ceiling discipline: it can upgrade, downgrade, or reframe the recommendation while keeping the action verb inside the evidence-supported ceiling.

## 5. Positive-Action Result

`MV-09` produced the cleanest positive-action signal. Public CoCounsel launch evidence plus Thomson Reuters legal-AI strategy supported an `Upgrade + Reframe` to `BOUNDED_MOVE_CAPABILITY_CAPTURE_WITH_DILIGENCE`.

That signal remains bounded. The receipt does not prove acquisition price, diligence sufficiency, pipeline strength, broad buyer willingness to pay, or integration success before cutoff. The valid result is positive action under diligence, not a public-proof acquisition mandate.

The later acquisition/integration path was directionally consistent with the at-cutoff bounded-move recommendation, but did not retroactively prove pre-cutoff public evidence of price, diligence, pipeline, or integration success.

## 6. Reverse-Case Result

The reverse-case signal is strongest in `MV-04` and `MV-05`. Both cases had visible first-order pressure that could have tempted a broad pricing or monetization commitment. In both, the second-order pass downgraded and reframed the valid ceiling:

- `MV-04`: from pricing and profitability pressure toward `HOLD_NARROW_PHASE_GRANDFATHER_MESSAGE`.
- `MV-05`: from API/data monetization pressure toward `SEGMENT_PRICE_LICENSE_PHASE_EXEMPT`.

The reverse-case lesson is that the method can be useful by preventing overreach, not only by finding moves to make.

## 7. False-`Move` Or False-`Commit` Avoidance Result

The receipts show repeated false-action avoidance:

- `MV-01` avoided treating AI-agent positioning as enough for an `Upgrade`.
- `MV-03` avoided a false all-in `Move` despite AI-content and data-value evidence.
- `MV-04` avoided a broad pricing `Commit`.
- `MV-05` avoided a false broad API-pricing `Commit` or blanket `Upgrade`.
- `MV-09` allowed only a bounded `Move` with diligence instead of a mandate.

This is one of the strongest method signals in the replay packet: valid action ceilings were narrowed where evidence did not support reliable-bet action.

## 8. Cases Useful, Wrong, Early, Late, Overconfident, Underconfident, Inconclusive, Or Blocked

| Outcome class | Cases | Packet interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Useful | `MV-01`, `MV-03`, `MV-04`, `MV-05`, `MV-09` | All five receipts classify the replay as useful in some form. |
| Wrong | None in accepted receipts | No receipt marks the method result wrong. |
| Early | None in accepted receipts | No receipt supports classifying a case as early. |
| Late | None in accepted receipts | `MV-03` and `MV-05` note conservatism on speed or scale, but the receipts do not establish a late-call classification. |
| Overconfident | None in accepted receipts | The receipts emphasize bounded ceilings and avoided false action. |
| Underconfident | Possible bounded signal in `MV-01`, `MV-03`, and `MV-05` | `MV-01` was conservative without buyer-pull proof; `MV-03` was conservative on speed; `MV-05` was conservative on speed and scale. These are calibration watchpoints, not replay failures. |
| Inconclusive | None in accepted receipts | No case is marked inconclusive, but buyer validation remains unproven. |
| Blocked | None in accepted receipts | No accepted receipt reports a blocked case. |

## 9. Strong Method Signals Against The Rubric

The following signals are measured against the replay rubric dimensions exposed by the base prompt: source visibility, Signal Integrity, Signal Use Classification, Decision Strength, Action Ceiling, recommendation verb discipline, calibration, and post-window comparison hygiene.

Strong signals:

- Multidirectional second-order effect: the method produced `Upgrade`, `Downgrade`, and `Reframe` outcomes rather than forcing a single pro-action bias.
- Action-ceiling discipline: no case escalated beyond its stated evidence basis.
- Positive-action boundedness: `MV-09` found a useful action signal while preserving diligence and price boundaries.
- Reverse-case protection: `MV-04` and `MV-05` show useful method value through avoided false `Commit`.
- Vendor and official narratives were not treated as buyer demand by default.
- Post-window evidence was not used to raise at-cutoff ceilings in the accepted receipts.

## 10. Weak Method Signals Against The Rubric

Weak or bounded signals:

- Buyer-pull proof remains absent or bounded in the receipts, especially for `MV-01`.
- `MV-03` and `MV-05` carry conservatism watchpoints on speed or scale.
- The packet is synthesized from compact receipts, so it does not independently re-audit source ledgers, source visibility, excerpt handling, or source-family fit.
- `MV-09` supports bounded capability capture, but not public-proof acquisition economics or integration confidence.
- `MV-01` has less clean leakage wording than the other receipts because its leakage note says post-window material stayed after seal; adversarial review should inspect whether that remains compatible with the anti-leakage contract.

## 11. Evidence-Standard Lessons

- First-order official or near-official evidence is enough to establish visible pressure, but not enough by default to prove buyer demand or reliable-bet action.
- Second-order public evidence is most useful when it changes the action ceiling, not when it merely adds more examples.
- `Reframe` is a meaningful method output. It can improve the valid response even when it does not justify `Upgrade`, `Move`, or `Commit`.
- Pricing, API, platform, and ecosystem changes require segmentation, exemptions, grandfathering, and message-risk checks before broad commitment.
- Capability capture can be justified before outcomes are obvious only when the recommendation remains bounded by diligence, price, integration, pipeline, and willingness-to-pay uncertainty.
- Post-window comparison calibrates the method but must not retroactively improve the at-cutoff action ceiling.

- external buyer willingness to pay;
- buyer urgency, budget ownership, or procurement feasibility;
- repeatable demand across segments;
- switching behavior, retention, expansion, or renewal impact;
- measurable ROI from any proposed Orca capability;
- production source availability, data rights, or source reliability;
- implementation feasibility, runtime feasibility, or integration feasibility;
- commercial packaging, pricing, sales motion, or market timing;
- whether customers would trust or repeatedly use a Core Spine v0 product.

## 13. Explicit Non-Claims

This packet does not claim:

- Core Spine v0 is validated;
- Core Spine v0 is accepted;
- Core Spine v0 is buyer-validated;
- Core Spine v0 is predictive;
- Core Spine v0 is feature-ready;
- Core Spine v0 is implementation-ready;
- Core Spine v0 is commercially ready;
- the five case artifacts have passed adversarial review;
- public evidence proves external willingness to pay;

- this Phase 6 packet independently revalidated source visibility or replay evidence.

## 14. Current Verdict

`PACKET_COMPLETE_FROM_ACCEPTED_COMPACT_RECEIPTS_USEFUL_BOUNDED_METHOD_SIGNAL_NOT_VALIDATED_READY_FOR_ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW`

Adversarial review may proceed next under a read-only review lane. It should review this packet and the sealed case artifacts against the replay contract, anti-leakage requirements, and the non-claim boundaries above. No adversarial review was performed in this packet phase.
