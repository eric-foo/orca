# IG Sustained-Cadence R-Probe — Design (v0)

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: probe design / measurement-method spec (non-authorizing; the RUN is owner-gated)
scope: >
  Design for a bounded, logged-out, self-terminating probe that measures R (safe
  reads/day) and rate-limit-onset behavior for the IG creator-momentum capture
  path — closing the H5 sustained-cadence-at-scale residual — and decides whether
  proxies / IP-rotation are warranted. Design only; the live RUN is owner-gated.
use_when:
  - Scoping or authorizing the H5 / R / rate-limit probe for the IG capture path.
  - Deciding whether proxies / IP-rotation are warranted (the conditional fork).
  - Turning the monitoring policy's illustrative R-tunable cadences into sized defaults.

stale_if:
  - The bounded R-probe RUN lands (turns this design's predicted onset into a measured R; closes H5).
  - The shipped calls runner changes its read model (max-items cap, scroll-pass enumeration, or onset detector).
  - The carve-out is amended in a way that changes the probe's posture bounds.

## Status

`DESIGN — AWAITING OWNER GO FOR THE RUN.` This is doc/spec work (default-allowed).
The probe **RUN** is live network / ToS-risk activity and is **owner-initiated**
per the wind-caller carve-out. Nothing here authorizes the run, a proxy build, or
any push/PR. Not validation, readiness, or a build-go.

## The question (what R is, precisely)

**R = safe reads/day**: how many logged-out IG page reads Orca can sustain per day
before **rate-limit onset** — the point at which IG returns a `429`
"please wait a few minutes" interstitial, redirects to `/accounts/login`, or shows
a network-security block.

R is **the one empirically-unmeasured number** in the creator-momentum lane. The
monitoring policy (`orca_creator_monitoring_policy_architecture_v0.md`) is built
around it: its read-budget bound is `reads/cycle ≤ R × cycle_days`, and R sizes
**Tier-A breadth** (how many creators get full age-bucket density). Its cadence
numbers are explicitly *illustrative and R-tunable* until R is measured.

### The H5 residual this closes
Per `ig_capture_findings_consolidated_v0.md`: single deep walks of one creator are
clean (no `429`; the reel path went 25 pages / 365 media with no wall). What is
**UNTESTED** is *repeated harvesting across many subject creators, over time*. The
probes to date are `n=1–2` feasibility GOs, not at-scale validations. This probe
measures that residual directly.

### The load-bearing insight: in the logged-out posture, R is per-egress-IP
The shipped runner is logged-out by construction, and the snapshot adapter opens a
**fresh browser context per capture** (`new_context()` → `goto()` → `browser.close()`),
so **no cookie/session state accumulates** between reads. There is no account to
ban — and none to spread load across. Therefore IG's logged-out rate limit is keyed
to the **egress IP / network fingerprint**, not to any session identity. Two
consequences that shape the whole probe:

- **Baseline R is a per-IP quantity.** "≤10 operating accounts" does **not**
  multiply throughput on one IP: logged-out contexts on one egress all share that
  IP's budget. (This is exactly why the carve-out's account cap counts *our
  operating accounts*, not subjects — and why on the logged-out path the binding
  resource is the IP, not the account.)
- **The proxies question is therefore a division.** Once per-IP R and roster demand
  are known, IPs-needed ≈ `ceil(roster_demand / per_IP_R)`. Proxies/IP-rotation are
  warranted **iff** one egress IP cannot carry the roster. Measure the numerator and
  denominator first; do not build mitigation before measuring the problem.

### What counts as a "read" (two levels — state both)
- **Invocation level** (what the operator drives): one runner invocation = `1`
  profile capture + `N` item captures, `N ≤ 12` (hard cap in the runner).
- **IG-request level** (what the rate limit actually sees): the adapter exposes
  **no network log**, so requests are *modeled*, not counted: a **profile** capture
  ≈ `1` document request + up to `scroll_passes` grid XHRs (default 3 ⇒ ≈ 4 IG
  requests); an **item** capture ≈ `1` document request (the `og:description` is in
  the initial document; item captures use `scroll_passes=0`). So one default
  invocation ≈ `(1+3) + 12 ≈ 16` IG requests, worst case. **R must be reported in
  IG-request units** (the rate-limit unit), with the invocation count alongside.
  *(True per-request counting would require adding a network log to the adapter — a
  separate owner-gated code change; not required for a first R reading, noted as an
  optional accuracy upgrade below.)*

## Instruments (use what is shipped; do not build new capture code to measure)

| Instrument | State | Role in the probe |
|---|---|---|
| `run_source_capture_ig_calls_packet.py` (shipped, logged-out, 832 tests, live `@hyram` 6/6) | **BUILT, merged** | The primary read generator. Drive it repeatedly across the subject set. |
| `_detect_ig_block()` inside that runner | **BUILT** | The **onset detector** — already classifies `redirected_to_login`, `rate_limited_429_interstitial`, `network_security_block`. Profile-level block ⇒ exit code `3` (NO-GO, no packet); item-level block ⇒ recorded per-item as `access_blocked` / `block_reason`. The probe reads these; it adds no new detection logic. |
| Reel/view-count cursor path (`web_profile_info` + grid `graphql/query`, `doc_id=7950326061742207`) | **FEASIBILITY-PROVEN, NOT built** | There is **no runner to drive**. So baseline R is measured with the **calls runner**. Reel-depth reads are an *additional* read class; characterizing their R is a deferred follow-up after that build (or an optional in-session manual cursor-walk — see Open decisions). Do not claim to "drive a reel runner"; none exists. |

**Tunable knobs the probe uses (existing CLI, no code change):** `--max-items`
(≤12), `--cadence-min-gap-seconds` / `--cadence-max-gap-seconds` /
`--cadence-window-seconds` (within-invocation pacing), `--cadence-random-seed`,
`--profile-scroll-passes`, `--output`. **There is no proxy/session knob** — by
construction (conforms to the carve-out's logged-out-only rule).

**Throughput envelope (so the time ceiling is realistic):** each capture launches a
fresh headless Chromium (~1–2 s) plus page-load plus the cadence gap. At the
runner's default gaps (8–45 s) a ~13-capture creator-invocation takes ≈ 5–6 min; a
5–8 creator pass ≈ 30–50 min. The ramp shortens gaps to raise reads/hour.

## Probe design

### Subjects (passive monitoring of already-flagged creators — not discovery)
A **small set of 5–8 public-figure beauty creators**, **US-first**, that are
**already flagged** (chosen before the run). Because the set is pre-chosen, the run
is **PASSIVE** monitoring (no discovery during it), which the carve-out permits as a
human-initiated, time-bounded, self-terminating session. The subject roster is
uncapped in doctrine; a small set is sufficient to generate sustained multi-creator
load without overreach.

### Operating context (carve-out account cap)
**Baseline phase: one egress IP / one operating context** (well within ≤10, start
≤5). Because R is per-IP, one egress is the correct unit to measure first. An
optional second phase may add a **second egress IP** to test whether R is additive
across IPs (the proxies-warranted follow-up) — deferred unless the owner opts in.

### The ramp (dimension = aggregate IG-requests/hour, raised in bounded rounds)
Start conservative, raise the aggregate read rate each round until onset or a hard
ceiling. The ramp deliberately pushes **faster than human-mimicking pace** — which
the 2026-06-15 passive posture authorizes ("faster than human, but not
takedown-risking") and which is the *only* way to find the wall.

| Round | Within-invocation gaps | Between-creator pause | Aggregate intent |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 (baseline) | default 8–45 s | ~2–5 min | One clean full pass over the set at human-mimicking pace. Onset here would be a strong NO-GO signal. |
| R2 | 2–8 s | ~30–60 s | ~3–5× R1 rate; repeat passes, accumulate reads. |
| R3 | 0.5–2 s | none (back-to-back) | Push toward the wall; keep accumulating until a stop condition fires. |

Re-running the same creator with a fresh `--output` each round is itself part of
"sustained cadence" (passive re-monitoring) and is the cheapest way to accumulate
reads without expanding the subject set.

### Stop conditions (bounded + self-terminating; first to fire wins)
1. **Onset (the measurement endpoint):** the first `_detect_ig_block()` hit of any
   class. Record cumulative reads-to-onset, wall-clock, round, and which class.
   **Do not push past onset** — this is the "not takedown-risking" guarantee:
   approach the wall once, detect it, retreat.
2. **Read ceiling `N_max`** (no-onset endpoint): default **≈ 800 IG-request-equiv
   reads** (owner-tunable). Reaching it without onset ⇒ R is reported as a **lower
   bound** (`R ≥ N_max / session_fraction_of_day`), not a point estimate.
3. **Time ceiling `T_max`:** a single attended sitting, default **≤ 3–4 hours**. No
   overnight / standing run.
4. **Manual abort:** the operator stops at any time.

### Optional: onset-recovery characterization (transient vs hard)
If onset fires before `N_max`, optionally: wait a bounded cooldown (e.g. 10 / 30 /
60 min), attempt **one** read, record whether access recovered. This distinguishes a
*soft rate limit* (recovers after cooldown ⇒ R is a rate, manage with pacing) from a
*hard block* (does not recover ⇒ R is a hard daily cap, proxies more likely). Keep
total added reads ≤ ~5; still self-terminating.

### What to record (per read, append-only)
Wall-clock; round; subject handle; capture kind (profile/item); cumulative
invocation count; **modeled IG-request count** (profile = 1 + scroll_passes; item =
1); runner exit code; per-item `status` (`captured` / `access_blocked` /
`no_signal` / `capture_failed`) and any `block_reason`; page-load latency if
available. The first row whose `block_reason` is set is the onset point.

## From measurement to R
- **Onset observed at cumulative `C` reads in elapsed `t`:** report **R ≈ C** as the
  per-IP safe daily budget if onset did not recover in cooldown (hard cap); if it
  recovered after cooldown `c`, report R as a *rate* ≈ `C / (t + c)` reads per
  recovery window, extrapolated conservatively to a daily figure with the recovery
  behavior noted. Always per-IP.
- **No onset by `N_max` in `T_max`:** report **R ≥ N_max** (lower bound) and note the
  probe did not reach the wall — a *good* outcome (one IP carries at least `N_max`/day).
  Do **not** invent a point estimate the data does not support.

R is reported in **IG-request units**, with the invocation count and the modeling
assumption (profile = 1 + scroll_passes XHRs) stated, so the monitoring policy can
consume it directly.

## Extrapolation to roster demand (the proxies math)
Using the monitoring policy's read-budget equation and its own illustrative IG
figures (Tier-A daily poster fully tracked ≈ ~10 reads/day; per-creator cap K≈30;
Tier-C heartbeat ≈ weekly):

```
roster_demand (reads/day) ≈ M × [ f_A · d_A + f_B · d_B + f_C · d_C ]
  where M = roster size; f_* = tier fractions; d_* = per-creator reads/day per tier
  illustrative: d_A ≈ 10,  d_B ≈ 1.5,  d_C ≈ 0.15
  illustrative mix f_A=0.10, f_B=0.30, f_C=0.60  ⇒  per-creator ≈ 1.54 reads/day
```

| Roster M | Illustrative roster_demand | per-IP R needed to avoid proxies |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | ≈ 308 reads/day | 1 IP suffices if measured R ≳ 308/day |
| 1,000 | ≈ 1,540 reads/day | 1 IP if R ≳ 1,540/day; else `ceil(1540 / R)` IPs |

**(All figures illustrative — R is unmeasured; M and the tier mix are owner inputs.)**

## The proxies decision rule (the conditional fork)
- **per-IP R ≥ roster_demand ⇒ proxies NOT needed.** One egress carries the working
  roster; record the headroom; revisit only if the roster or cadence grows.
- **per-IP R < roster_demand ⇒ proxies/IP-rotation WARRANTED.** Estimate IPs ≈
  `ceil(roster_demand / per_IP_R)`, subject to a follow-up **additivity check** (the
  optional 2nd-IP phase, or a later probe) because subnet/fingerprint correlation may
  mean N IPs deliver < N×R. **The proxy BUILD remains separately authorized** — this
  probe only decides *whether it is warranted*, not how to build it.

## Carve-out conformance checklist (load-bearing)
Governed by `wind_caller_calibration_carveout_v0.md` as amended 2026-06-15:

- [x] **Logged-out only** — runner has no cookie/session path; never wire one in.
- [x] **Operating-account cap** — 1 egress for baseline (≤10 / start ≤5); the cap
      counts our operating contexts, not subjects.
- [x] **Subjects** — small set of already-flagged, US-first public-figure creators;
      **passive** (no discovery during the run).
- [x] **No standing/scheduled crawler** — human-initiated, time-bounded, self-
      terminating single session; hard `N_max` / `T_max` ceilings; no daemon.
- [x] **Pace** — ramps *faster than human* (authorized) but **stops at first onset**
      (approach-and-retreat = "not takedown-risking"); never sustains past the wall.
- [x] **RUN is owner-initiated** — live ToS-risk activity; not launched here.
- [x] **Retention** — probe records are operational measurements (read tallies /
      onset), not person dossiers; subject material stays within the 10-year /
      takedown posture.

## Owner-gated RUN procedure (ready to authorize; do not run until owner go)
Run from `orca-harness/`. One invocation per (creator, round); unique `--output`
each time (the runner refuses to overwrite an existing staging parent). Example
single invocation:

```
python runners/run_source_capture_ig_calls_packet.py \
  --profile-url "https://www.instagram.com/<handle>/" \
  --decision-question "R-probe: logged-out IG safe-reads/day onset (H5)" \
  --output "_test_runs/r_probe/<round>/<handle>/" \
  --max-items 12 \
  --cadence-min-gap-seconds <round_min> --cadence-max-gap-seconds <round_max> \
  --cadence-window-seconds 900 --cadence-random-seed <round>
```

The orchestration across (creators × rounds) is a **thin shell/PowerShell loop over
this existing CLI** plus an append-only log of the per-read fields above — **no new
committed runner code** for a first reading. On the first `_detect_ig_block` hit
(exit `3` at profile, or an `access_blocked` item), the loop **stops**. Outputs go
to the gitignored `_test_runs/` scratch.

## Open decisions for the owner (before the RUN)
1. **Subject set** — which 5–8 already-flagged US-first creators (or accept an
   operator-chosen set at run time).
2. **Ceilings** — confirm/adjust `N_max` (~800 reads) and `T_max` (~3–4 h).
3. **Reel read class** — include an optional in-session manual cursor-walk to
   characterize reel-depth R (uses the proven-but-unbuilt mechanism), or defer it
   until the reel runner is built? Default: **defer**.
4. **2nd-IP additivity** — include the optional second-egress mini-phase to test R
   additivity now, or defer until baseline R says proxies are warranted? Default:
   **defer**.
5. **Per-request accuracy** — accept modeled IG-request counts for a first reading,
   or first add a network log to the adapter (separate code change)? Default:
   **accept the model**.

## Non-claims
Design / measurement-method only — not authorization for the run, a proxy build, or
any push/PR; not validation, readiness, buyer-proof, or commercial authorization.
"Shipped" / "feasibility-proven" refer to the instruments' states recorded in
`ig_capture_findings_consolidated_v0.md`; the reel path is not built. All
extrapolation figures are illustrative (R is unmeasured) until the RUN lands.
