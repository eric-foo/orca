scope: >
  Consolidates the scattered per-source capture RECON / INVESTIGATION findings across
  the toolbox, data-capture-spine pressure tests, research receipts, and worktree-resident
  lane findings into one index. Records, per source probed, what was found capturable, at
  which runner rung, where the signal actually lives, and any corrected false-diagnosis.
  This index is the evidence base the capture-investigation doctrine + runbook distil from.
use_when:
  - Drafting the source-agnostic capture-investigation doctrine and per-archetype recipe cards.
  - Checking whether a source archetype already has a worked recon before re-probing it.
  - Locating the highest-signal real probe receipts (captured bytes / live-verified verdicts).
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
open_next:
  - docs/product/data_capture_spine/data_capture_harness_operating_model_architecture_v2.md
stale_if:
  - A new source recon lands (this index is append-only until the doctrine supersedes it as the home).
  - The worktree-resident findings (Sephora/Bazaarvoice reviews; Ulta Apollo embedded-JSON) merge to main.
  - The capture-investigation doctrine is authored and adopts the cross-cutting patterns below as its spine.

# Capture Recon Consolidation Index (v0)

## What this is — and is not

This is a **non-authorizing index** of the capture RECON / INVESTIGATION findings already
in the repo — the docs that probed a real source to learn **whether and how it can be
captured**. It exists so the capture-investigation doctrine and its per-archetype recipe
cards are **distilled from real probe evidence, not invented**.

It is **not** a build spec, not validation, not an acceptance claim, and not legal advice.
Verdicts below are **as reported by each source doc**, not re-observed here. It governs
nothing; it feeds the doctrine.

## Cross-cutting patterns — the doctrine seed (highest-value section)

These six patterns recur across independent probes. They are the spine the investigation
doctrine should encode.

1. **"Blocked" is a hypothesis, not a verdict — and it is the dominant false-diagnosis.**
   A 403 / empty body / "anti-bot gated" read was *wrong or imprecise* in multiple
   independent cases: Daimler PDFs (direct-HTTP 403 **and** headless 403, yet **visible
   Chrome + the PDF-viewer download button succeeded**); Sephora reviews (worktree:
   "anti-bot gated" → actually a **scroll-overshoot** that never fired the lazy-load
   observer); Teal/WSO (403 first recorded as "content unavailable," later re-diagnosed as
   an anti-bot gate). **Escalate the interaction (real browser context → user-initiated
   action → progressive scroll → proxy/geo) and re-probe before recording NO-GO.** A false
   "blocked" abandons a capturable source.
2. **Locate the signal substrate first; pick the tool second.** Reddit = raw JSON;
   reviews = a first-party-rendered vendor API (Bazaarvoice); SPA state =
   `__APOLLO_STATE__` / `__NEXT_DATA__` (Ulta, worktree); PDF body = a download button.
   The cheapest working rung is a function of **where the signal lives**, so step 1 of
   diagnosis is finding the substrate, not choosing a runner.
3. **Verbatim-vs-paraphrase is a separate axis from reachable-vs-blocked.** WebFetch
   *reaches* M&I/BIWS but returns **paraphrase**, losing layout/packaging fidelity. A
   recipe must record whether a rung preserves source **bytes**, independent of whether it
   gets through.
4. **The entitlement/legal gate is orthogonal to the technical gate and comes first.**
   LinkedIn policy forbids automated capture **regardless** of technical reachability;
   Reddit's API has a commercial-use gate. A NO-GO can be *legal*, not technical. Never
   bypass an unentitled gate even when it is technically trivial.
5. **NO-GO and PARTIAL are first-class, honest outcomes.** Daimler pre-cutoff archive
   returned **no memento exists** → an honest NO-GO; archive *availability* ≠ body
   *retrieval* → PARTIAL. Concluding "not cleanly capturable within boundary" is a
   *successful* diagnosis, not a failure.
6. **The runner ladder is empirically real and cheapest-first.** archive.org →
   direct-HTTP → **(visible) browser** → cloakbrowser+proxy. "Visible browser + a
   user-initiated action" is a genuine escalation rung that defeats headless-detection
   where both direct-HTTP and headless fail (Daimler).

| Reddit thread **DISCOVERY** (screening seam) — find thread URLs without an external index | this row + `docs/workflows/reddit_candidate_intake_old_reddit_search_surface_handling_v0.md` (parse) + `docs/workflows/reddit_capture_to_ecr_consumption_probe_finding_v0.md` (live receipt) | Reddit-**native** search/listing surface (`search-title`/`title`→`/comments/` anchors), direct-HTTP rung; an external search-engine index is the wrong surface | **PARTIAL→GO** — listing live-fetch GO (prior live run, HTTP 200 → 10 thread URLs); search-surface live receipt + `.json` rate posture = named residual | HIGH |

**Reddit thread discovery (screening seam) — working read shape.** *[discovery-spine cross-lane commission, 2026-06-11]*
- **Substrate (pattern 2):** Reddit's *own* search/listing is the discovery surface; the external search-engine index is the wrong surface — the discovery walk's zero-result on `site:reddit.com` queries is expected, **not** a capture gap. Native surfaces: `old.reddit.com/r/<sub>/search?q=…&restrict_sr=on` (+ `&sort=`/`&t=` window), subreddit listings `/new`, `/top?t=`, and their `.json` variants.
- **Rung (pattern 6, cheapest-first):** **direct-HTTP** is already GO on old.reddit *listing* (prior live run: HTTP 200 → 10 candidate thread URLs) and *thread body* (ECR-consumption probe: HTTP 200 ~104 KB). Parse with the documented `search-title`/`title`→`/comments/` anchors, then run the empty-result surface-shape check before any NO-GO (pattern 1: "blocked" is a hypothesis).
- **Entitlement (pattern 4, gate first):** logged-out public old.reddit page reads sit under the owner-authorized public-content posture; the licensed Reddit **Data API** (commercial-use gate) is a *separate* route not needed for discovery. The existing intake doc's "do not call `.json`" hard stop is that lane's *no-live-mode* discipline, **not** a global entitlement bar — but unauthenticated `.json` is rate-limited / ToS-bounded, so treat it as a direct-HTTP-rung route at human rate with backoff.
- **Residual (the one unproven leg):** a live receipt for the **search** surface specifically (the listing and thread fetches are receipted; the `…/search?q=` fetch is not) and the `.json` rate ceiling. Strong GO prior. Probe shape: one bounded logged-out direct-HTTP GET of `old.reddit.com/r/<sub>/search?q=<query>&restrict_sr=on&sort=new` → record status / bytes / `/comments/`-marker count; escalate visible-browser→CloakBrowser only if direct-HTTP is gated. No standing crawler, no scheduler.
- **Consumer:** the beauty card-set cards 4–6 access caveat. **Update 2026-06-12 (ingestible-beauty screen-1 ledger, "Tooling Discovery"):** the WebFetch tool *itself* blocks `reddit.com` for screening agents — so this read shape is GO for the capture-harness HTTP runner but **not usable by WebFetch-based screening agents**. The cards 4–6 caveat is therefore replaced only once the runner is wired as a bounded screening-read service (`docs/decisions/screening_reddit_read_route_decision_v0.md`); until then, screening Reddit reads = search snippets only. The search-surface receipt residual is closable only by the capture runner, not a screening agent.

| Instagram wind-caller — own `@foo_yu_quan` + third-party `@hyram` *(2026-06-14)* | `docs/product/source_capture_toolbox/ig_wind_caller_capture_feasibility_recon_v0.md` | Attended logged-in browser (own + 1 public third-party, no wall). **Grid = index only**; capture is **per-item: each `/p/` AND `/reel/` page, one-by-one**. Per item → **full verbatim caption in the rendered DOM node** (meta `og:description` truncates ~59% on a post, ~86% on a reel) + **likes/comments/date/`#ad` sponsorship flag**. Enumerate via **scroll pagination** (12 → 48 / 3 passes). Stats → profile `og:description`/header + Social Blade free (recent daily window; deep history premium) + `web_profile_info` JSON (counts only). `direct_http` NO-GO for signal (200 shell; API **429 cookieless** → **200 logged-in**). | **GO (demonstrated, n=2)** — self-capture calls via DOM (moat), **buy** stats series (Social Blade free). Residual: sustained cadence (H5), full enumeration, robust caption selector, **reel view/play count (in GraphQL JSON, not page DOM)**. Harness-native authenticated capture **already exists** (browser_snapshot + auth_state + runners + cadence, authorized/reviewed); IG = compose + small delta (loop runner, extraction, reel warm-JSON, block markers) — see ig_wind_caller_calls_capture_build_architecture_v0.md. | HIGH ⭐ |
| Instagram reel **view/play count** — `@hyram` 3 reels *(2026-06-14)* | `docs/product/source_capture_toolbox/ig_reel_viewcount_capture_feasibility_recon_v0.md` | **Profile-feed JSON** (`web_profile_info` + grid `graphql/query` pagination), **logged-out 200**, `video_view_count` per media keyed by `shortcode` — **not** on the reel permalink page (surfaces A/B/C empty there). | **GO logged-out — incl. deep history.** `video_view_count` reachable **cookieless in a browser context** (refines prior "API 429 cookieless"); cursor-following the grid `end_cursor` paginated **25 pages, all `200`, 365 media back to 2017**, **no wall / no `429`**; **session run byte-identical → unnecessary**. Residual: sustained cadence at scale (H5 / multi-account-over-time). | HIGH ⭐ |

**IG reel view/play count (2026-06-14).** Closes part of the prior IG recon's "reel view/play count (in GraphQL JSON, not page DOM)" residual and **refines** its "`web_profile_info` API 429 cookieless → 200 logged-in" line: in a real browser context (IG's `X-IG-App-ID`/web headers) `web_profile_info` returned **200 cookieless** carrying `video_view_count` per media, keyed by `shortcode`; the earlier 429 was the **header-less `direct_http`** rung, not a browser-context XHR. The signal lives in the **profile feed**, not the reel page, so a build folds into the **existing logged-out grid load** — not a per-reel or session capture. **IG reel view/play count — corrected (2026-06-14).** First reported "walls early" from a UI-scroll probe; that was an **artifact** (a DOM login-heuristic that fired regardless of auth, and `mouse.wheel` never triggering IG's infinite-scroll — identical logged-out/session results were the tell — recon **Pattern 1**). The valid method, **following the grid's own `end_cursor` via the `graphql/query`**, paginated **25 pages all `200`, 365 media back to 2017-08-22**, **logged-out**, no wall / no `429`; the **session run was byte-identical** → session buys nothing. Net: `video_view_count` is reachable **logged-out incl. deep history**; the session lane is **retired** for this purpose. **One residual:** sustained cadence at scale (H5 / multi-account-over-time).

## Coverage map

- **Well-covered:** forums/threads (Reddit ×4, WSO), pricing (M&I, Teal, OpenAI-lane), archive/history (Daimler, Unity), docs-PDF body (Daimler — the strongest anti-bot escalation case), browser runner (CloakBrowser), reviews (ClickUp + Sephora-pending).
- **Thin / single-fixture:** docs-changelog (Kubernetes only), reviews (one merged fixture; the strong one is worktree-pending), SPA embedded-state (Ulta worktree-pending only).
- **ABSENT / PARTIAL — directly relevant to the stated multi-source product direction:**
  **TikTok has no technical recon at all.** **Instagram is now probed** (own-account
  wind-caller recon, 2026-06-14 — **GO demonstrated** at the attended logged-in browser rung;
  see the Social networks table). The only other social probe is the LinkedIn *policy*
  boundary. Any TikTok recipe card is **speculative** until probed; social surfaces carry the
  heaviest ToS/auth-wall/anti-bot posture (entitlement gate, Pattern 4, applies before any
  technical attempt). No media/video capture recipe exists either. (IG media/video capture is
  likewise still unprobed — the IG recon covered caption text + stats, not media bytes.)

## Pending-merge / external (not on main; include before the doctrine finalizes)

- **Sephora/Bazaarvoice reviews finding** — worktree `orca-cloak-scroll-wt`, in squash `0faf262`, force-push pending. The single best **reviews** diagnosis (and the canonical "blocked was wrong" lesson).
- **Ulta Apollo embedded-JSON (DP-002)** — demand-projection lane worktree, unmerged. The single best **SPA-embedded-state** diagnosis.
- **OpenAI price payload (rung-1.5)** — `orca-rung15-wt`, unmerged. Best **pricing-embedded** diagnosis.
- **Operator-supplied / gitignored scratch** (evidence, not tracked): `docs/_inbox/data_capture_pressure_test_operator_supplied_2026_05_29/...`; `orca-harness/_test_runs/{cloakbrowser_api_probe,source_quality_slot3_*}/`.

## Non-claims

Not an authorization, not a build spec, not validation/readiness/acceptance, not legal
advice. Verdicts are as reported by each source doc. The absence of a TikTok/IG probe is a
**sweep result** (no such recon surfaced across the main-tree docs), not a proof that none
could exist. Worktree-resident findings are **claimed by their lanes** and unverified here
until merged.
