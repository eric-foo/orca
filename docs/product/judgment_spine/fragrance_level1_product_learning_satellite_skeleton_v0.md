# Fragrance Level 1 Product-Learning Satellite Skeleton v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Judgment Spine product artifact (fragrance Level 1 product-learning satellite skeleton)
scope: >
  Defines the slot skeleton for a fragrance-specific Level 1 Judgment satellite
  that imports core Judgment boundaries by pointer and reserves, but does not
  complete, the casebook, source, evidence, weighting, forecast, decision,
  reveal, lesson, and receipt surfaces.
use_when:
  - Authoring or reviewing the first fragrance Level 1 product-learning pack.
  - Deciding where fragrance casebook, source, weighting, forecast, decision, reveal, and lesson fields belong.
  - Checking the non-claims before any fragrance prompt, source-capture, run, scoring, or proof work.

  - The conductor changes its no-authority invariant, by-hand cap, JSG routing, or run-authorization boundary.
  - The demand-read core, C2, C3, near-half, far-half, or signal-ledger surfaces are accepted, rejected, or materially amended.
  - A fragrance casebook admission artifact accepts, rejects, or materially changes the first Level 1 cases.
  - An owning source-capture artifact admits fragrance venue/source families or authorizes capture.
  - A completed fragrance product_learning_receipt exists.
```

## Status

This is a docs-only skeleton for the first fragrance satellite. It is useful
because it names the slots a real fragrance pack must fill without forcing those
slots to be filled now.

Claim cap: product-learning context only. The current closeout state for this
artifact's own claim is `unreceipted_product_learning_context`: durable context
and a skeleton exist, but there is no admitted casebook, no source-capture
authority, no completed evidence packet, no run, no scoring receipt, no
product-learning receipt, no buyer-proof receipt, and no judgment-quality
receipt.

## Operating Rule

Core owns the judgment machinery. Fragrance owns the domain instances.

This skeleton must import core Judgment boundaries by pointer instead of
restating or replacing them:

- Claim tiers, closeout states, receipt minima, and promotion gates come from the
  evidence ladder.
- JSG routing, no-authority discipline, run authorization, and the by-hand cap
  come from the conductor.
- C0-C4 demand-read shape comes from the demand-read core.
- Qualitative weighting comes from C2; no numeric weight, score, formula, or
  deterministic apply-rule belongs here.
- Verdict and action ceiling come from C3; fragrance may map examples onto
  `act`, `phase`, `narrow`, `hold`, or `defend`, but it must not mint new action
  vocabulary.
- Forecast, reveal, evaluation, and lesson fields are product-learning inputs
  unless later owner gates promote them.

## Current Claim Classification

## Per-Case Record Shape

Use this as a slot checklist, not as a completed schema. Empty or unknown fields
must stay empty or `unknown`; do not backfill with guesses.

## Source-Family Starting Hints

The beauty venue card-set is the starting pointer for fragrance venue hints. It
does not authorize capture or monitoring.

Initial candidate hints:

- Basenotes: fragrance subtle-class tracker; direct HTTP was observed as 403 in
  the card-set, with search snippets as a possible screening route.
- Fragrantica: tracker/aggregator; direct HTTP was observed as 403 in the
  card-set, with snippets only.
- Specialist fragrance blog cluster: outcome gauge; direct fetch was observed
  as workable in the card-set.

These are candidate fields for a future source/evidence slice. They are not
current evidence, not source-family admission, and not permission to run source
capture.

## Forecasting Boundary

Forecasting is a learning input, not the center of the Judgment claim. A
forecast field may help compare sealed expectation to later outcome, but the
evidence ladder frames Judgment as the best move under the evidence available at
the decision point.

For this satellite:

- Forecasts must be sealed before reveal if they will be evaluated.
- Outcome comparison may produce product-learning notes.
- A correct outcome call does not prove the judgment was good.
- A wrong outcome call does not automatically prove the judgment was bad.
- Calibration, buyer proof, and judgment-quality claims require their own gates.

## Casebook Admission Boundary

This skeleton does not admit the first cases. Before any case is treated as more
than a candidate, a later artifact should record at least:

- the case ID and decision family;
- cutoff date/time and post-cutoff exclusion rule;
- source families allowed for the pre-cutoff packet;
- outcome label and measurement window;
- exclusion criteria;
- whether the case is for learning-only, blind backtest, or another owner-chosen
  mode;
- explicit non-claims.

## Prompt Boundary

This artifact is not a prompt, wrapper, handoff, rerun prompt, or patch prompt.
If any fragrance prompt is needed, author it through `workflow-prompt-orchestrator`.

## Next Docs-Only Moves

1. Author the first fragrance casebook admission artifact.
2. Author a fragrance source/evidence plan that consumes the beauty venue
   card-set by pointer and routes capture authority to the source-capture owners.
3. Create a first per-case product-learning receipt template or example only
   after the casebook and evidence slots are bounded.
4. Use prompt orchestration only if a prompt artifact is actually needed.

## Non-Claims

This artifact is not validation, readiness, buyer proof, product proof,
judgment-quality evidence, prompt approval, run authorization, scoring
authorization, source-capture authority, conductor amendment, C2/C3 adoption,
casebook admission, source-family admission, or owner adoption of the fragrance
temp pack.

It does not assert that the fragrance Level 1 plan works. It only gives the
first fragrance satellite a repo-local shape that future docs can fill without
claim inflation.
