# Orca Discovery Candidate Scan - Imaginary Authors MGT v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Research artifact (bounded MGT screen-light targeted scan)
scope: >
  One commissioned forward-mode bounded intelligent-walk scan of Imaginary
  Authors as a US indie/DTC fragrance seed. Records public precursor signals,
  negatives, access notes, and capture_request handoffs without capture,
  judgment, demand proof, route binding, or buyer proof.
use_when:
  - Reviewing the first controlled targeted scanning-lane rehearsal for a
    CSB-selected fragrance brand.
  - Deciding whether any Imaginary Authors public assortment, SKU, launch,
    restock, channel, or discontinuation signal should route to Capture.
  - Checking why no forward candidate observation was minted from this scan.

stale_if:
  - Any promoted observation is used after the 21-day forward scan-to-use window
    without fresh re-verification.
  - Imaginary Authors changes the observed official PDP, collection,
    availability, or restock-notify state.
  - Capture verifies, rejects, or supersedes any capture_request below.

## Frontier Ledger

| Move | Frontier | Yield class | What happened | Stop check |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M01 | Official Imaginary Authors fragrance collection, `https://imaginaryauthors.com/collections/frontpage` | EVIDENCE | Current official fragrance surface listed 22 products, with `UNTAMABLE`, `A LITTLE SECRET`, `HOW TO SAY BICYCLE IN FRENCH`, and a sold-out `Beach Reads` sample set visible; collection availability summary showed 21 in stock and 1 out of stock on the first page. | a:no b:no c:no |
| M02 | Official all-products collection, `https://imaginaryauthors.com/collections/all` | EVIDENCE | Broader official assortment showed `A LITTLE SECRET - FRAGRANCE` marked `New`, `Dipped in Chocolate - FRAGRANCE` marked sold out, `IS THIS STILL LIFE - CANDLE` marked `New`, and 68 in-stock / 5 out-of-stock products across 71 results. | a:no b:no c:no |
| M03 | Official `A LITTLE SECRET` PDP, `https://imaginaryauthors.com/products/a-little-secret` | EVIDENCE | Current official PDP showed 50ml and 2ml purchasable while `50ml + Mug` was sold out; notes and launch story are visible. | a:no b:no c:no |
| M04 | Official `Dipped in Chocolate` PDP, `https://imaginaryauthors.com/products/dipped-in-chocolate` | EVIDENCE | Current official PDP showed the 50ml SKU sold out, restock-notify UI, and Salt & Straw partnership language. | a:no b:no c:no |
| M05 | Ministry of Scent Imaginary Authors collection, `https://ministryofscent.com/collections/imaginary-authors` | EVIDENCE | Retailer collection showed 28 Imaginary Authors products, including `A Little Secret`, `Untamable`, sample-set sellouts, and `First Peach of the Season` with sample add enabled and one review. | a:no b:no c:no |
| M06 | Allure peach-trend article, `https://www.allure.com/story/peach-perfumes-trend-summer-2026` | EVIDENCE | Fresh editorial surface published 2026-06-19 placed an Imaginary Authors peach perfume inside a 2026 peach-fragrance trend. | a:no b:no c:no |
| M07 | Livingetc Anthropologie candle-collab article, `https://www.livingetc.com/shopping/imaginary-authors-anthropologie-candles` | EVIDENCE | January 2026 editorial surface reported an Imaginary Authors x Anthropologie candle trio/discovery-set collaboration. | a:no b:no c:no |
| M08 | Exact public search for `First Peach of the Season`, `Dipped in Chocolate`, and `A Little Secret` community/review traces | VENUE-DRY | Search did not surface a better public, product-specific community origin within the cap beyond the retailer/editorial surfaces already read. | a:no b:branch-close c:no |
| M09 | Public search around `Whispered Myths`, `Telegrama`, and discontinued-tag vocabulary | VENUE-DRY | No current public forward-mode source surfaced inside the cap; an irrelevant generic `telegram` result appeared and was discarded. Historical pool row not used as evidence. | a:no b:branch-close c:no |
| M10 | CSB/AEO seed-query family search around `top indie perfume brands in the US` | INFLUENCE-OBS | Current search returned broader category surfaces, including fresh peach/niche fragrance coverage; useful as visibility annotation only, not demand-origin proof. | a:no b:no c:no |

Declared frontiers closed:

- Official owned site and product surfaces: productive, but owned-only.
- Retail/PDP surfaces: productive through Ministry of Scent; retail is G4/channel corroboration only.
- Specialist community surfaces: dry inside cap; Reddit/Basenotes-style real reads remain orchestrator-mediated if needed.
- Search/AEO surfaces: visibility annotation only; no independent demand-origin proof.
- News/editorial/trade mentions: productive for trend/channel context; not sufficient to mint a candidate.

Stop reason: all remaining public frontiers had decayed to low expected value
inside the move cap, and the next useful work would be Capture-owned
preservation or orchestrator-mediated public community screening.

## Candidate Observation Decision

No candidate minted.

Reason: the scan found several current precursor signals worth preserving or
checking, but none met the forward candidate-promotion threshold. The live
signals were owned availability states, retailer listings, and editorial/search
visibility. They did not show a gradeable costly-behavior floor in an
independent demand-origin venue, and laundered/channel surfaces cannot be
double-counted as demand origins. Retail presence stays G4/channel
corroboration only.

## Negatives And Access Notes

- `NEG-001`: Exact public searches for `Whispered Myths`, `Telegrama`, and
  discontinued-tag vocabulary did not surface a current forward-mode public
  signal inside the cap. The known historical SKU-kill row remains decision
  shape only, not current evidence.
- `NEG-002`: Exact product/community searches around `First Peach of the
  Season`, `Dipped in Chocolate`, and `A Little Secret` did not surface a
  better public origin than the official/retailer/editorial surfaces above.
- `ACCESS-001`: Reddit/Basenotes-style real community reads were not pursued
  directly. The loaded walk contract treats these as wall-prone or
  orchestrator-mediated screening reads; this scan records the need rather than
  crossing into direct capture or auth-gated access.
- `NEG-003`: AEO/search surfaces produced visibility and category context, not
  independent demand-origin proof, and were not promoted beyond precursor
  routing.

## Closeout

`SCAN_COMPLETE`.

Next lane may:

- re-fetch and preserve the three capture_request URL sets under Capture-owned
  route, entitlement, and provenance rules;
- run an orchestrator-mediated public community screening read only if Capture
  or the owner wants to test independent demand-origin surfaces for the three
  precursor clusters;
- discard this scan after 2026-07-12 for forward slot use unless the
  load-bearing observations are freshly re-verified.

Next lane must not:

- treat this artifact as validation, readiness, demand proof, buyer proof, gate
  clearance, candidate admission, or source-class ratification;
- use the 2024 historical Imaginary Authors backtest row as a forward-mode slot
  source;
- infer route binding, capture permission, packet commitment, ECR, Cleaning, or
  Judgment work from this scan.
