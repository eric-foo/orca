# Orca Fragrance-Native Database Live Probe v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Research artifact
scope: CSB-first live probe and capture-route pinning receipt for fragrance-native databases.
use_when:
  - Seeding Capture from a bounded Scanning/probe pass over Fragrantica, Parfumo, and Basenotes.
  - Reconstructing why Fragrantica and Parfumo are preservation candidates while Basenotes is not pinned in this environment.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
source_paths:
  - docs/research/orca_specialist_fragrance_precursor_surface_csb_board_v0.md
  - orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/source_capture_playbook_v0.md

  - orca/product/spines/foundation/vertical_exploration/orca_vertical_exploration_guide_v0.md
  - orca/product/spines/scanning/README.md
stale_if:
  - Any probed site changes access posture or page substrate.
  - A later packet-grade Capture run preserves raw source bodies and supersedes these screen-light observations.
  - Basenotes becomes reachable through a new anti-bot, proxy, archive, or entitled manual route.
  - The Parfumo Chrome-extension/user-visible browser route stops reaching real product DOM, or direct HTTP/AJAX becomes reliably reachable again.

```

## Broad Scout Return

This bounded `broad_scout_return` checked three fragrance-native database frontiers from the CSB board: Fragrantica, Parfumo, and Basenotes. It included exact-query discovery for Basenotes and Parfumo URL resolution, venue evaluation by direct HTTP, anti-block HTTP, and visible browser reads, hidden venue pointers for correct Parfumo product routing, negatives and access notes for Basenotes, and recency/current-state preservation pressure where public product pages returned source-visible body markers. Recommended main deepening: run packet-grade preservation only for Fragrantica and Parfumo using their pinned direct-HTTP product routes; keep Basenotes as a no-pin re-probe target until a new access fact appears.

The probe did not rank databases, prove demand, scrape at volume, create monitoring, stage packets, touch ECR, or authorize Data Lake work.

## CSB Board Intake

Board source: `docs/research/orca_specialist_fragrance_precursor_surface_csb_board_v0.md`.

Rows consumed as route map: SBR-001, SBR-002, SBR-003, SBR-007, SBR-010.

## Negatives And Access Notes

- `NEG-001`: The initially guessed Parfumo product URL redirected to `/404`; the correct product URL came from Parfumo perfume search.
- `ACCESS-001`: Basenotes direct HTTP returned Cloudflare 403 for homepage and search.
- `ACCESS-002`: Basenotes anti-block HTTP returned Cloudflare `cf-mitigated` challenge pages for homepage and search.
- `ACCESS-003`: Basenotes visible browser read rendered security-verification text, not source-native content.
- `ACCESS-004`: DuckDuckGo snippet mining for Basenotes returned anomaly/challenge pages and no usable result links.

  This packet was written to the configured ORCA_DATA_ROOT path observed as
  F:/orca-data-lake/raw/930/01KW7SGXRZHFTS372X391Z8GHV because the environment
  variable overrode the requested scratch output. Treat this as a generated
  packet fact, not fixture admission, not routine Data Lake handoff, and not a
  source-completeness claim.

  For the current Parfumo full-corpus lane, use the Chrome extension /
  user-visible browser route as the primary capture route. Preserve the initial
  rendered DOM/visible text/screenshot and pursue full review/statement depth
  through bounded same-tab first-party page/AJAX interactions from that visible
  browser context. Direct HTTP/AJAX remains an opportunistic canary/fallback if
  it becomes reachable again, not a success dependency. Anonymous or proxied
  non-extension rendered capture is not ruled out forever, but it is currently
  blocked and should not gate this lane.

  - no cookie export or clearance-token transfer
  - no CAPTCHA solving service

### Basenotes Exact Product Re-Diagnosis Addendum

```yaml
operator_question: >
  Should Basenotes wait for the Fragrantica lane structure, or should it be

route_answer: >
  Do not wait for Fragrantica to complete before diagnosing Basenotes access.
  Wait for Fragrantica/Parfumo before building the shared projection and
  Cleaning shape, but Basenotes has a separate access bottleneck that must be
  proven independently before it can adopt the same wrapper structure.

  receipt_warning: residual Cloudflare challenge marker
  integrity_note: >
    The packet metadata recorded `access_blocked: false`, but the rendered
    title and visible text show an interstitial. Under the source-capture
    playbook's rendered-access honesty rule, this is classified as blocked
    source access, not a successful source read.
diagnosis_verdict: no_working_pin_current_environment_reconfirmed_exact_product
why_this_matters: >
  The failure is no longer just a Basenotes search-page or BR540 locator issue.
  A known exact product URL also fails through direct HTTP and anonymous
  CloakBrowser, so Basenotes should remain CSB/Scanning value plus access-note,
  not Capture-wrapper work, until a materially different access route is proven.
next_route_condition: >
  Re-probe only with a new access fact: approved proxy/profile route, stored
  manual browser session success, owner-supplied entitled/rendered bytes, a
  verified exact BR540 URL that returns source-visible content, or a usable
  archive/snippet route that exposes product or thread content rather than an
  access interstitial.

## Route Pins
| Pin ID | Source | Step 0 access classification | Signal substrate | Cheapest working route | Verdict | Re-probe trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PIN-001 | Fragrantica | publicly-viewable public web content | large product-page HTML plus search HTML | `direct_http` with at least 2 MB cap for product pages | pinned_for_capture_probe | route returns block shell, body degrades, product markers disappear, or packet field extraction cannot preserve source-visible content |
| PIN-002 | Parfumo | publicly-viewable public web content, but bot-mitigated for anonymous/proxied automation in the current environment | product-page DOM plus first-party review/statement AJAX hooks observed in the operator's visible Chrome browser | `chrome_extension_user_visible_rendered_session`; direct HTTP/AJAX is canary/fallback only | pinned_for_current_full_corpus_capture_route | Chrome extension route returns Cloudflare/block shell, product DOM markers disappear, AJAX hook shape changes, owner withdraws live-browser authorization, or direct HTTP/AJAX becomes reliably reachable again |
| PIN-003 | Basenotes | publicly-viewable but bot-mitigated in current environment | source content not reached; Cloudflare challenge seen across direct, anti-block, browser, search-snippet, and known exact-product routes | none pinned | no_working_pin_current_environment_reconfirmed_exact_product | new anti-bot/proxy route, manual visible-browser success, usable archive/snippet locator, verified non-interstitial exact product URL, or owner-supplied entitled bytes |

## Candidate Decision

```yaml
candidate_decision:
  closeout_state: capture_preservation_only
  independent_origins_seen:
    - Fragrantica product page substrate reachable by direct HTTP
    - Parfumo product page substrate reachable by visible Chrome extension route
  reason: >
    The probe found two preservation-worthy public product-page substrates and
    one high-value but currently blocked source. Parfumo's June 29 direct/AJAX
    route is now demoted to canary/fallback after current Cloudflare blocks; the
    current Parfumo full-corpus route is the operator-visible Chrome extension
    route. This supports packet-grade preservation requests for Fragrantica and
    Parfumo only, not demand proof, not full database capture, and not a
    Basenotes capture route.
```

## Closeout

`capture_preservation_only`.

Fragrantica is pinned as a direct-HTTP product-page preservation route and current-window review substrate, but it is not complete review-corpus capture. Parfumo's June 29 direct product-page plus first-party AJAX route is retained as historical evidence and a future canary/fallback, but the current full-corpus route is the Chrome extension / operator-visible browser route; this addendum did not run the full 369-review / 1390-statement corpus. Basenotes is explicitly not pinned in this environment; direct HTTP, anti-block HTTP, screening browser, search-page CloakBrowser, and known exact-product CloakBrowser all failed to reach source content. One Fragrantica packet landed in the configured ORCA data root during the completeness check; that is a generated packet fact only, not fixture admission, routine Data Lake handoff, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, monitoring, commercial readiness, or full-database crawling.
