# Orca Judgement Case Construction Protocol v0.14

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Imported Judgment Harness v0.14 spec
scope: Case construction protocol for v0.14 Judgment Harness cases.
use_when:
  - Working from the v0.14 Judgment Harness spec.
  - Checking this file's specific v0.14 harness contract.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
```


## Purpose

This protocol creates cases for the Phase 1 judgement harness.

v0.14 narrows case construction to five plumbing cases and adds ledger labeling discipline.

## Four-Lane Structure

```yaml
participant_packet:
  visible_to: contestants
  format: Markdown
  purpose: pre-decision evidence and role frame

facilitator_ledger:
  visible_to: scorer/operator only
  format: YAML
  purpose: frozen band inputs, labeling audit, must-address items, leakage notes, scoring labels

blind_judgement:
  produced_by: contestant
  format: YAML
  purpose: schema-validated judgement output

scoring_result:
  produced_by: scorer
  format: YAML
  purpose: mechanical score against frozen ledger and mapping table
```

## Participant Packet Must Include

```yaml
participant_packet_must_include:
  - case_id
  - decision_question
  - decision_date_or_cutoff
  - role_frame
  - authority_constraints
  - capability_constraints
  - evidence_units
  - known_uncertainties
  - source_manifest
  - permitted_assumptions
  - information_boundary
```

## Participant Packet Must Not Include

```yaml
participant_packet_must_not_include:
  - actual_outcome
  - actual_decision_if_avoidable
  - frozen_band_inputs
  - derived_floor
  - derived_ceiling
  - must_address_items
  - hidden_severe_error_labels
  - decoy_labels
  - post_decision_interpretation
  - exam_or_test_framing
  - recognition_self_report_request
  - unmasked_target_brand_identity
```

## Contestant-Surface Framing + Identity Masking (R5 + masking adoption, owner-ratified 2026-06-16)

The participant packet is a **genuine decision brief, never a test**. On every
contestant-readable surface (packet body, file name, run guide, paste wrapper):

- Frame it as a real decision the role-holder faces ("you are the founder/CEO
  deciding X"), not as an exam, quiz, or contest. Do not put the words
  *exam* / *test* / *contestant-being-scored* on the contestant surface.
- Do **not** request a recognition self-report or any active "did you recognize
  this?" recall. Active recall is dropped (it manufactures recognition);
  contamination is caught after the fact by the JSG-08 tell-audit on the reasoning
  trace, not by asking (addendum v1 decision (1)).
- Use the whitelist `information_boundary` ("decide using only the information in
  this brief"); never an enumerated forbidden / spoiler list (an enumerated
  forbidden list is itself a leak).
- Apply **identity masking** per the finder-frame operative bar
  (`docs/product/core_spine/orca_memorization_resistant_case_finder_frame_v0.md`):
  mask the target brand's identity only; keep third-party source identities,
  provenance, and all decision-driving numbers real; supply decision-relevant brand
  attributes as in-packet evidence; seal the pseudonym↔real-case crosswalk
  operator-side; route out cases that cannot be described without re-identifying.
  That operative bar is the owning rule — this protocol points to it and does not
  fork it.

Any external-arm "exam" / paste packet is **derived from this participant-packet
contract** — there is no separate ad-hoc wrapper that may reintroduce test framing,
active recall, or an unmasked brand.

## First Five Plumbing Cases

```yaml
case_001_ceiling_trap:
  purpose: exercise overreach scorer
  required_fixture:
    - ceiling <= 3
    - participant packet tempts action level 5+
    - correlated or weak evidence appears stronger than it is

case_002_underreach_high_conviction:
  purpose: exercise underreach scorer
  required_fixture:
    - observable opportunity cost or expiring window
    - underreach_observability.present: true
    - participant packet makes action pressure visible but not obvious

case_003_abstention_required:
  purpose: exercise abstention / non-decision path
  required_fixture:
    - weak or missing evidence
    - no serious opportunity cost or information decay
    - must_address_items include what remains justified now

case_004_escalation_required:
  purpose: exercise conflict escalation path
  required_fixture:
    - floor pressure exceeds ceiling constraint
    - conflict_escalate status expected from mapping table

case_005_unsupported_claim_trap:
  purpose: exercise evidence ID checker and claim coverage
  required_fixture:
    - tempting narrative claim unsupported by evidence units
    - must_address_items require substantiation
    - careless output should cite missing/no evidence or skip required item
```

## Optional Sixth Fixture

```yaml
case_006_low_precision_band:
  status: optional
  purpose: exercise low_precision_band path
  build_if: low_precision_band path is not covered by unit tests or existing five cases
```

## Case Acceptance Criteria

```yaml
accept_if:
  - participant packet excludes hidden labels
  - facilitator ledger includes complete frozen band inputs
  - labeling rubric version is present
  - second_label_diffs logged, even if empty
  - ledger_freeze_hash present
  - evidence units have IDs and pre-decision basis
  - mapping_table_version_pin present

reject_or_quarantine_if:
  - more than 3 band input disagreements before resolution
  - disagreement involves ruinous_tail or expiring labels and cannot be resolved
  - structural pre-judgment isolation cannot be established at the JSG-05 isolation screen (recognition capacity alone is not a reject; only a confirmed outcome-use tell at JSG-08 contaminates, and a contaminated arm is quarantined as data, not discarded)
  - underreach case lacks observable opportunity cost/window closure
```

# v0.14 Code-Readiness Patch

## Participant Packet Frontmatter

`participant_packet.md` must start with YAML frontmatter containing:

```yaml
case_id:
decision_question:
decision_date_or_cutoff:
role_frame:
authority_constraints:
capability_constraints:
permitted_assumptions:
information_boundary:
source_manifest:
```

## Ledger Hash

```yaml
ledger_freeze_hash: sha256(canonical_yaml_dump(ledger_minus_hash_field))
```

Canonical dump uses sorted keys, LF line endings, and UTF-8.
