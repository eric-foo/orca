| Case-track preflight | `docs/research/judgment-spine/cases/canoo-walmart/case_track_preflight_v0.md` | Created; recommends source-packet step under zero-spoiler cutoff discipline |
| Source packet | `docs/research/judgment-spine/cases/canoo-walmart/source_packet_v0.md` | Created; clean pre-cutoff source substrate candidate |
| Safety receipt | `docs/research/judgment-spine/cases/canoo-walmart/safety_receipt_v0.md` | Created; adversarial review completed before participant packet |
| Adversarial source-packet review | `docs/review-outputs/adversarial-artifact-reviews/canoo_walmart_source_packet_safety_adversarial_artifact_review_v0.md` | Completed; recommendation `accept_with_friction` for participant-packet authoring |

| Blind judgments | `docs/research/judgment-spine/cases/canoo-walmart/blind_judgments_v0.md` | Created; user-supplied blind LLM contestant result, not independently verified clean |
| Owner-context judgments | `docs/research/judgment-spine/cases/canoo-walmart/owner_context_judgments_v0.md` | Created; owner-assisted judgment, separate from blind result |
| Pre-reveal judgment comparison | `docs/research/judgment-spine/cases/canoo-walmart/pre_reveal_judgment_comparison_v0.md` | Created; freezes comparison between blind LLM and owner-assisted judgments before reveal |
| Facilitator ledger | `docs/research/judgment-spine/cases/canoo-walmart/facilitator_ledger_v0.md` | Created; sealed facilitator-only actual-action, agreement, and outcome source ledger |

## Selection Rule For Case 2

Do not start case 2 from brand prestige or consulting-firm authorship alone. Select the next case because it has a reconstructable decision, clean cutoff, visible tradeoff, revealed action or outcome, and enough source depth to expose judgment misses.

## Non-Claims

- This manifest does not validate the Judgment Spine.
- This manifest does not prove the Milwaukee lesson transfers.
- This manifest does not make any case product-ready, buyer-validated, or model-training-ready.
- This manifest does not authorize scraping, automation, fine-tuning, custom infrastructure, or a miner.
