## Status

Status: `SOURCE_QUALITY_MIXED_SOURCE_TRIAL_CLOSEOUT_V0`.

This artifact closes the first mixed-source trial of the Mini God-Tier
source-quality structure. It records what the trial showed about the current
profile, queue template, runbook report block, and Source Capture Armory
packet outputs.

The trial used already-bounded Canoo/Walmart source units. It did not discover,
select, rank, score, admit, or judge sources.

## Trial Question

Can the Mini God-Tier structure produce consistent, inspectable source-quality
report outcomes across different source postures without relying on agent
memory or informal packet-success inference?

The trial answer is yes for operating structure, with one clear next helper
need: agents need a small report-skeleton helper that reads packet manifests and
raw metadata into profile-shaped report blocks so they do not manually rebuild
the same posture logic each time.

## Source Units

| source_id | Source posture tested | Runner outcome | Result token | Lifecycle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CW-P4` | PRNewswire historical source where archive body could satisfy cutoff posture | Archive.org packet preserved availability metadata and selected snapshot body | `mini_god_tier_met` | `scratch` |
| `CW-P1` | Walmart historical source where archive availability existed but no eligible cutoff body was selected | Archive.org packet preserved availability metadata only | `archive_body_not_preserved` | `scratch` |
| `CW-P6` | SEC filing body where stable current official body could be preserved by Direct HTTP | Direct HTTP packet preserved SEC inline XBRL body and response metadata | `mini_god_tier_with_visible_limitations` | `scratch` |

All rows reached `reported` state for this trial. None reached
`separately_admitted`.

## Trial Findings

1. The profile successfully separated packet-write success from source-quality
   status. CW-P1 had exit code 0 and empty manifest limitations, but still
   correctly classified as `archive_body_not_preserved` because no eligible
   archive body was selected.
2. The queue/report split worked: after packet inspection, all three rows could
   move from packet-written posture to `reported` with profile-owned result
   tokens.
3. The runbook network-permission discipline worked: live network-backed
   runners were run with per-operation network permission instead of spending a
   first failed attempt on sandbox network refusal.
4. The current packet manifests contain enough structured fields to support
   report skeleton generation, but humans still have to inspect raw metadata and
   selected files to classify archive/body and anchor posture correctly.
5. SEC inline XBRL is body-preserved but awkward for manual source-language
   anchor extraction. Future helper work should support term-window or
   source-visible anchor probes without scoring or interpreting source meaning.

## Helper Requirements Implied

A smallest complete helper for the next checkpoint should:

- read one or more Source Capture Packet `manifest.json` files;
- emit a Mini God-Tier report-block skeleton using existing profile fields;
- carry packet path, preserved files, hashes, byte counts, access posture,
  archive posture, media posture, cutoff posture, capture time, and non-claims;
- detect archive packets where availability metadata exists but no snapshot body
  is preserved;
- avoid treating empty `limitations` as clean capture;
- leave source-language anchors as operator-fillable by default, with optional
  bounded term probes only when explicitly supplied;
- never admit fixtures, score source quality, decide Judgment meaning, run ECR
  or Cleaning, discover sources, fetch new sources, or change packet outputs.

The helper should optimize for report consistency, not inference.

## Non-Claims

This closeout is not validation, readiness, source completeness proof, fixture
admission, rights clearance, retention policy, sensitivity review, source
discovery, source selection, source-quality scoring, Judgment scoring, ECR
design, Cleaning implementation, buyer proof, commercial-readiness evidence, or
authorization for new adapters, APIs, crawlers, browser fallback, commercial
fetch, or production runtime.
