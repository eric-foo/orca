- This is **evidence organization**, not a verdict and not product authority.
- Current completion: `STEP-01` through `STEP-09`.

## What This Is / Is Not

**Is:** a completed N=3 evidence surface that records the current source inputs, a compact comparison of Slot 1, Slot 2, and Slot 3, and the cross-slot evidence organization needed for commissioner review.

**Is not:** the batch verdict, the patchable-vs-architecture-threatening classification, a contract amendment, an obligation-state/handoff call, a source-access implementation scope, a product-readiness claim, or Data Capture Spine validation.

## Stale / Historical Surfaces

The interim N=2 synthesis is now historical input because Slot 3 has a combined handoff. Its correction that Slot 3 was not reliably reachable remains useful background, but this N=3 artifact supersedes it as the batch-level evidence surface for the current three-slot batch.

The continuation handoff `docs/prompts/handoffs/orca_data_capture_pressure_test_ca_handoff_prompt_v0.md` is historical for current sequencing because it describes Slot 3 as an open fork. Slot 3 now has a combined first-pass handoff artifact.

## Batch Status: N=3 of 3

| | Slot 1 (M&I / BIWS) | Slot 2 (Teal) | Slot 3 (Reddit + WSO) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Source-family stress | Finance-specialized pricing, bundle structure, archive/history, product-page posture | AI-generic resume-tool pricing, docs/features, changelog/history, host-block posture | Forum/review threading, anonymous actors, deletion/edit/lock posture, review-surface recency |
| Decision tie | jb pricing and bundle-positioning against finance-specialized substitute flank | jb positioning/pricing against AI-generic resume-tool flank | Validate non-target US-domestic resume-gap pain language and reach venues |
| Capture status | Operator-filled capture complete | Operator-filled capture complete | Combined first-pass handoff recorded across Reddit and WSO |
| Access / capture environment | Live M&I/BIWS reachable, but WebFetch returned paraphrase rather than verbatim; archive content tool-blocked | Full content block: `tealhq.com` 403 plus `web.archive.org` content tool-block; URL/search/archive-availability posture only | Reddit operator-supplied local raw JSON/screenshots/MSP; WSO pointer-level public-page inspection with no local raw HTML/screenshot corpus |
| State spread | 9 `met` / 6 `partial` / 1 `not_applicable` | 8 `met` / 4 `partial` / 1 `not_applicable` / 3 explicit out-of-vocabulary gap states | 8 `met` / 7 `partial` / 1 `not_applicable` |
| Out-of-vocabulary state pressure | No declared out-of-vocab state, but #12 reached for `indeterminate` / `cannot_assess` as finding F-C | #6 and #12 declared `cannot_assess`; #16 declared `insufficient`; all explicitly labeled as contract gaps | No out-of-vocabulary states; limitations expressed using existing `partial` / `not_applicable` vocabulary |
| Handoff posture | `visible_stop` with `re-capture_posture` for verbatim marketing-language and archive slices | `visible_blocker` with `re-capture_posture` for anti-block/403 and archive-access fetch paths | `categorical_handoff_to_ECR` as bounded first pass with visible limitations |
| Checker posture | Pass 1 `capture_closure_blocker`; pass 2 `vocabulary_divergence` with one look-alike prose issue and labeled proposals | Pass 1 `capture_closure_blocker`; pass 2 `vocabulary_consistent` with all out-of-set values treated as labeled proposals | Reddit `visible_capture_limitation`; WSO `visible_capture_limitation`, with WSO checker recorded as artifact-internal rather than separate manual GPT-5.5 invocation |
| Mechanical Source Projection posture | Not used | Not used | Used for Reddit as Data Capture-owned projection over preserved raw; 563 projected rows reported, with raw preserved |
| Most visible capture limitation | Paraphrase instead of verbatim/structure; visual packaging cues not preserved; archive content inaccessible | Zero verbatim source observable; full-block state vocabulary gap; decision-content absent | Mixed venue posture: Reddit raw/projection-backed but incomplete media/archive/timing; WSO pointer-level only, no full comment graph or local raw corpus |
| Primary evidence value | Surfaces verbatim/structure, archive, and multimodal/screenshot fetcher requirements under a reachable source | Surfaces anti-block/403 requirement and explicit discharge-vocabulary gaps under full content block | Tests mixed forum corpus handoff, MSP utility, and limitation visibility without source-completion or Judgment drift |

## Cross-Slot Findings By Evidence Class

These are evidence classes for commissioner review, not verdict categories.

| Evidence class | Slot 1 signal | Slot 2 signal | Slot 3 signal | Batch-level read, without verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Raw observable / source fidelity | Live source was reachable, but WebFetch preserved paraphrase rather than verbatim source language, layout, and packaging cues. | Live and archive content were both inaccessible; zero verbatim source observable was preserved. | Reddit raw JSON, screenshots, and MSP rows were preserved; WSO remains pointer-level / public-page-limited with no local raw HTML or screenshot corpus. | The batch repeatedly distinguishes "facts/pointers captured" from "source observable preserved." This is the strongest source-access-method input, not a commissioner classification. |
| Archive / history posture | Archive snapshot existence was visible, but archive content retrieval was tool-blocked. | Archive snapshot availability worked, but `web.archive.org` content was tool-blocked again. | Reddit and WSO external archive lookup was not attempted; local preservation exists for Reddit raw and screenshots. | Archive posture is consistently visible, but archive content capture remains unresolved. Slot 3 adds a "not attempted / local preservation only" form rather than another archive-content block. |
| Access degradation visibility | Paraphrase and archive tool-blocks were recorded; visibility obligations still discharged. | Full host/content block was recorded exhaustively; failure-visibility obligations were strong. | Venue-specific limits are explicit: Reddit raw/projection-backed, WSO pointer-level, WSO full comment graph not claimed. | The contract is good at making access degradation visible. Whether the vocabulary is expressive enough under severe degradation remains a separate candidate issue. |
| Discharge vocabulary pressure | Existing vocabulary held in declared cells, but #12 reached for `indeterminate` / `cannot_assess` as a finding. | Existing vocabulary broke in declared cells: #6 and #12 used `cannot_assess`; #16 used `insufficient`, each explicitly labeled as out-of-contract. | Existing vocabulary held: limitations expressed as `partial` / `not_applicable` without out-of-vocabulary states. | Vocabulary pressure is not uniform. It appears strongest when the raw observable is absent or when #16 is judged failed rather than merely limited. |
| Handoff posture | `visible_stop` plus `re-capture_posture`; no clean handoff due to paraphrase / modality loss. | `visible_blocker` plus `re-capture_posture`; decision-content absent under full block. | `categorical_handoff_to_ECR` as bounded first pass with visible limitations. | The three slots produce a useful gradient: stop, blocker, and bounded handoff. The #16 / handoff-readiness vocabulary should be reconciled before hardening. |
| Operator / agent boundary | Operator attempted to delegate #13; agent declined, preserving operator-led discipline. | Operator's downstream-use instinct on #13 was surfaced and kept out of the discharge cell. | Combined handoff records no ECR schema, Cleaning, Judgment, runtime, or source-quality scoring. | Role-boundary drift appeared as visible pressure, not silent capture output. The completed hold/drift section below carries the batch-level interpretation. |
| Checker behavior | Pass 1 returned `capture_closure_blocker`; pass 2 found one look-alike prose issue and correctly treated labeled proposals as proposals. | Pass 1 returned `capture_closure_blocker`; pass 2 treated all out-of-set values as labeled proposals, not divergences. | Reddit and WSO each carried `visible_capture_limitation`; WSO checker was artifact-internal, not the stricter separate GPT-5.5 invocation. | The checker did not uniformly rubber-stamp. However, Slot 3's checker posture is not fully equivalent to Slot 1/2 because of the WSO invocation limitation. |
| Mechanical Source Projection | Not used. | Not used. | Used only for Reddit: 563 projected rows over preserved raw, with raw retained and one `more_placeholder` visible. | MSP has a positive but narrow data point: it helped preserve/read a Reddit thread corpus without replacing raw or becoming Cleaning/Judgment. The completed MSP section below keeps that interpretation narrow. |

## Source-Access / Fetcher Requirement Set

These are requirements surfaced by pressure-test evidence. They are **not** implementation authorization.

1. **Verbatim + structure preservation.** Slot 1 makes this load-bearing: paraphrase preserved prices and bundle names but not source wording, marketing language, layout, emphasis, table placement, nesting, proximity, or other source-visible structure where those carry signal. Slot 2 confirms the lower bound: zero verbatim content makes the source-backed promise fail entirely.

2. **Archive snapshot content retrieval.** Slot 1 and Slot 2 both show that knowing archive snapshots exist is not the same as capturing archive content. Slot 3 adds a separate posture: archive lookup was not attempted, while local Reddit raw/screenshots were preserved. Requirement: capture must be able to record archive existence, archive content access, and not-attempted/local-only archive posture distinctly.

3. **Multimodal / screenshot capture where layout or media carries signal.** Slot 1 surfaces layout/packaging capture for bundled offers. Slot 3 adds forum-specific media pressure: Reddit screenshots exist, but linked image/gallery assets were not independently archived, and WSO has no screenshot corpus. Requirement: preserve visual state when layout, screenshots, resume images, galleries, or page chrome carry signal.

4. **Anti-block / 403-handling access for discoverable-or-entitled sources.** Slot 2 is the clearest case: every live Teal fetch returned 403 while the source surfaces were still public/product pages. WSO also has earlier direct WebFetch 403 history, although the final WSO first pass used public web inspection rather than a full raw corpus. Requirement: future source-access method should support disclosable, allowed retrieval paths that handle origin/edge refusal without crossing hard-stop boundaries.

5. **Thread / comment graph capture and continuation handling.** Slot 3 surfaces this directly: Reddit preserves available post/comment trees but has one `more_placeholder`; WSO full comment graph and hidden/comment-unlocked material are not claimed. Requirement: forum capture needs explicit handling for continuation placeholders, visible reply paths, locked/deleted/edit posture, and "full graph not captured" limits.

6. **Acquisition timestamp and source-hash discipline.** Slot 3 shows source hashes and artifact dates are useful but not a substitute for exact per-thread or per-page acquisition timestamps. Requirement: future capture should separate source timestamps, source edit timestamps, operator acquisition timestamps, archive timestamps, and artifact-write timestamps where feasible.

7. **Projection over preserved raw for high-volume threaded material.** Slot 3 Reddit shows MSP can turn preserved raw JSON into readable projected rows while keeping raw available. Requirement: projection remains a helper over raw, must retain row reachability and warnings, and must not become Cleaning, Judgment, or evidence-row filtering.

## Discharge-Vocabulary And Contract-Refinement Candidates

These are candidate contract questions only. This section does not amend the obligation contract and does not classify the candidates as patchable or architecture-threatening.

1. **`cannot_assess` / `indeterminate` state candidate.**
   Evidence:
   - Slot 1 #12 / F-C: fairness ceiling became indeterminate because the capture lacked faithful verbatim ground truth.
   - Slot 2 #10 / S2-2: historical content was judged unable to be assessed even though archive posture was partially recorded.
   - Slot 2 #6 and #12 / S2-3: zero raw observable and zero related context under full block could not be represented cleanly by the six existing states.
   Contract question: should the discharge vocabulary include a state for "required and attempted, but unassessable from the captured observable," or should affected obligations be reworded to mark assessment as conditional on faithful capture?

2. **`insufficient` / `assessed_not_met` state candidate.**
   Evidence:
   - Slot 2 #16 / S2-5: handoff sufficiency was judgeable and judged not satisfied, but the existing six states had no clean value for "required, attempted, assessed, not satisfied due to capture access failure."
   Contract question: should the discharge vocabulary include a judged-failed state distinct from `partial`, `blocked`, and `unavailable_by_source`?

3. **Tool/origin block versus boundary `blocked`.**
   Evidence:
   - Slot 1 F-D and Slot 2 carry-forward: `blocked` was reserved for source-boundary violation or out-of-bounds access, not origin/tool access failure to otherwise in-bound material.
   - Slot 2 full block showed this distinction is load-bearing: using `blocked` for a 403 would corrupt the later classification.
   Contract question: should the obligation contract explicitly separate "boundary blocked" from "access failed / tool-origin blocked" so operators do not overload `blocked`?

4. **#16 handoff-readiness versus actual categorical handoff.**
   Evidence:
   - Slot 1 F-F: #16 blends readiness assessment with the actual handoff act, which was treated as impossible in that phase because no ECR receiver existed.
   - Slot 2 #16 / S2-5: handoff sufficiency was assessed but judged insufficient, producing `visible_blocker`.
   - Slot 3 combined handoff uses `categorical_handoff_to_ECR` as a bounded first-pass posture, conditional on ECR receipting limitations without turning them into Cleaning/Judgment.
   Contract question: should #16 distinguish "handoff-readiness posture" from "actual ECR receipt / handoff act" to reconcile the slot-level usage?

5. **Fact preservation versus source-language / structure preservation.**
   Evidence:
   - Slot 1 F-A and F-B: prices and bundle facts survived paraphrase, but source wording and structure remained decision-relevant.
   - Slot 2 confirms the failure mode at the extreme: when no verbatim observable exists, even fact-level claims become ungrounded.
   Contract question: should Obligation 6 separate fact preservation, source-language preservation, visible structure preservation, and modality preservation, with frame-keyed sufficiency?

6. **Checker token gloss for `capture_closure_blocker`.**
   Evidence:
   - Slot 1 F-H: the token was initially read as "blocked, must rerun," colliding with the discharge state `blocked` and the handoff vocabulary.
   - Slot 2 still used the token productively, but only because out-of-set values were explicit and the checker distinguished proposals from divergences.
   Contract question: should the checker token be renamed or paired with a mandatory gloss such as "not clean categorical handoff under current artifact" to prevent operator confusion?

7. **Formal adoption of the pass-2 vocabulary-consistency checker.**
   Evidence:
   - Slot 1 pass 2 caught a look-alike prose issue while treating labeled proposals as proposals.
   - Slot 2 pass 2 classified all out-of-set values as labeled proposals, not divergences.
   - The commissioning plan pins pass 1; pass 2 is useful evidence but not yet formally adopted in the commissioning plan.
   Contract question: should pass 2 become part of the pressure-test operating model, remain optional, or stay as a one-batch diagnostic?

## What Held Across The Batch

This section records boundary evidence for commissioner review. It does not decide whether the evidence is patchable or architecture-threatening.

1. **Failure visibility held better than source fidelity.**
   - Slot 1 made paraphrase and archive-content tool-blocks visible.
   - Slot 2 made a full host/content block visible without converting it into fake capture success.
   - Slot 3 made venue-specific limitations visible: Reddit raw/projection-backed, WSO pointer-level only.
   - Batch read: the current operating model is better at recording visible capture limits than at guaranteeing faithful source observables under weak tools.

2. **Capture stayed mostly out of Judgment.**
   - Slot 1 and Slot 2 surfaced operator temptation around downstream use and #13, but kept that pressure out of final capture discharge cells.
   - Slot 3 did not assign credibility, Decision Strength, Action Ceiling, source-quality scores, attention priority, or exclusion/discounting calls.
   - Batch read: Judgment-bound pressure appeared, but it stayed visible as pressure rather than silently becoming Capture output.

3. **Capture stayed out of Cleaning and ECR schema design.**
   - Slot 1 and Slot 2 did not normalize, dedupe, cluster, or transform captured evidence into cleaned claims.
   - Slot 3 used Mechanical Source Projection only as a readable projection over preserved raw, not as Cleaning, ECR schema, or Judgment.
   - No slot defined final ECR fields, keys, storage, IDs, tables, or receipt schema.
   - Batch read: the Capture/ECR/Cleaning boundary held in artifact behavior, even where #16 vocabulary became strained.

4. **Source-family satellite discipline held at the synthesis level.**
   - Finance-specialized pricing, AI-generic tool pages, and threaded forum/review material produced different capture stresses.
   - This draft records source-family-specific requirements without promoting any one source-family rule to core.
   - Batch read: source-family variation is real, but this evidence does not itself satisfy a promotion bar for core architecture change.

5. **Vocabulary pressure is localized but material.**
   - Slot 1 created candidate language pressure without using out-of-vocabulary cell states.
   - Slot 2 explicitly used out-of-vocabulary states under full content block.
   - Slot 3 fit limitations into existing state language, but only as a bounded first pass with incomplete venue coverage.
   - Batch read: the vocabulary problem is not universal, but it is decision-relevant when capture has no faithful observable or when handoff sufficiency is judged failed.

6. **No-drift evidence is strongest around forbidden outputs, not around tooling adequacy.**
   - The slots did not claim validation, readiness, buyer proof, product readiness, runtime authorization, ECR schema, Cleaning design, or Judgment design.
   - The slots did surface source-access-method shortcomings: paraphrase, archive content block, 403 block, missing media/archive/timestamp coverage, and incomplete forum graph capture.
   - Batch read: the pressure test supports "capture boundaries can be respected under stress" more strongly than "current capture methods are adequate."

## Mechanical Source Projection Interpretation

MSP has one useful but narrow batch data point: Slot 3 Reddit.

What the batch supports:

- MSP can make a high-volume threaded source inspectable without replacing preserved raw.
- The Reddit projection reported 563 projected rows and preserved row reachability to raw source material.
- The projection kept a visible `more_placeholder` instead of silently pretending the thread graph was complete.
- The projection did not become Cleaning, Judgment, semantic dedupe, source-quality scoring, or evidence-row filtering in the recorded handoff.

What the batch does not prove:

- It does not prove MSP works across WSO, pricing/product pages, archive snapshots, image/gallery media, or blocked hosts.
- It does not prove projection completeness for all Reddit continuations, linked media, galleries, deleted material, or exact acquisition-time reconstruction.
- It does not prove MSP warrants a hardened contract requirement.
- It does not prove MSP can replace raw preservation, external archive attempts, screenshots, or source timestamps.

Commissioner-facing read:

The batch provides one useful Reddit MSP data point, but does not yet provide evidence across WSO, pricing/product pages, archive snapshots, image/gallery media, or blocked hosts that would support promotion to final contract doctrine. The next decision is whether a second MSP pressure point, optional-helper posture, or narrow projection-packet candidate obligation is the right gate, with raw preservation remaining prior to projection.

## Checker Behavior Interpretation

The checker behavior is useful evidence, but uneven across slots.

What the checker evidence supports:

- Slot 1 pass 1 produced `capture_closure_blocker`; pass 2 identified one look-alike vocabulary/prose issue while correctly preserving labeled contract proposals as proposals.
- Slot 2 pass 1 produced `capture_closure_blocker`; pass 2 treated all out-of-contract values as labeled proposals rather than vocabulary divergence.
- Slot 3 produced `visible_capture_limitation` for Reddit and WSO rather than a false clean pass.
- Across the batch, checkers did not uniformly rubber-stamp operator work.

What remains unproven:

- Slot 3 WSO checker posture is not equivalent to Slot 1/2 because it was artifact-internal rather than a separate manual GPT-5.5 checker invocation.
- Pass 2 is not yet formally adopted in the commissioning plan.
- `capture_closure_blocker` remains linguistically risky because it can be confused with the discharge state `blocked` or with a rerun mandate.
- Checker output has not been tested against a genuinely clean categorical handoff with no visible capture limitation.

Commissioner-facing read:

The checker setup provides useful pressure-test diagnostic evidence, especially when paired with a vocabulary-consistency pass, but the batch does not establish validation, readiness, or mandatory operating doctrine. The open decision is whether pass 2 becomes part of future pressure-test runs and whether checker result tokens need a glossary before hardening.

## Commissioner Decision Queue

These are the next decisions this synthesis prepares. This artifact does not answer them.

1. **Batch classification.**
   Decide whether the N=3 evidence points to patchable contract/method refinements, architecture-threatening failure, or an insufficient-evidence hold. The evidence most relevant to this decision is the combination of: source-access failure modes, vocabulary-count ambiguity, and strong no-drift behavior around forbidden outputs. The vocabulary-count question is explicit: Slot 1 surfaced a vocabulary-gap reach in F-C (`indeterminate` / `cannot_assess`) without using an out-of-vocabulary discharge-table value; Slot 2 used explicit out-of-vocabulary discharge values (`cannot_assess` for #6/#12 and `insufficient` for #16); Slot 3 stayed inside existing discharge vocabulary. Whether Slot 1 F-C counts as a threshold-crossing instance alongside Slot 2's explicit breakage is a commissioner judgment, not a synthesis verdict.

2. **Source-access method planning.**
   Decide whether to authorize a bounded source-access method planning lane for verbatim/structure capture, archive-content retrieval, screenshot/media preservation, anti-block handling, thread-graph capture, timestamp discipline, and raw-preserving projection. This decision would authorize planning only unless separately expanded.

3. **Discharge vocabulary refinement.**
   Decide whether the obligation contract needs states or obligation rewrites for `cannot_assess` / `indeterminate`, `insufficient` / `assessed_not_met`, and tool/origin block versus boundary `blocked`.

4. **Obligation #16 split.**
   Decide whether #16 should distinguish handoff-readiness posture from actual ECR receipt/handoff act.

5. **Obligation #6 fidelity split.**
   Decide whether #6 should explicitly separate facts, source language, visible structure, modality, and frame-keyed sufficiency.

6. **Mechanical Source Projection next gate.**
   Decide whether MSP remains optional, receives a second pressure-test point, or becomes a narrow projection-packet candidate obligation subordinate to raw preservation.

7. **Checker operating model.**
   Decide whether pass 2 vocabulary-consistency checking becomes required, optional, or retired; and whether `capture_closure_blocker` / `visible_capture_limitation` need mandatory glosses.

8. **Further pressure testing before hardening.**
   Decide whether these three slots are sufficient for a commissioner classification, or whether another bounded batch is needed before any contract-hardening move.
