## Status And Decision

Status: `ACCEPTED_LANE_LOCAL_DELTA_INPUT_V0`.

Owner decision: `ACCEPT_POST_SLOT3_RECAPTURE_DELTA_AS_LANE_LOCAL_INPUT`.

The owner accepts the reviewed-and-patched post-Slot-3-recapture all-slot delta
as lane-local input to one narrow docs-only, non-implementation
source-observability requirements-boundary decision.

Acceptance admits the delta as input to a future decision. It does not make the
delta the decision itself, the requirements basis, product doctrine, architecture
doctrine, workflow authority, validation evidence, readiness evidence,
implementation authority, or source-of-truth material.

## Source Basis

Decision inputs:

- Current owner instruction: proceed from the scoped route to write the
  lane-local acceptance decision.
- `docs/product/data_capture_spine_pressure_test_all_slot_synthesis_post_slot3_recapture_delta_v0.md`,
  SHA256 `43B7903ED3A173A17CC8C9C71780F43158744932A3BF5A72B9C3178F4F4DB302`.
- `docs/review-outputs/adversarial-artifact-reviews/data_capture_spine_post_slot3_recapture_delta_adversarial_artifact_review_v0.md`,
  SHA256 `C2E894C91ED787D7879579EAA35DF03006F97739F20DE43AC348274D9BB7D544`,
  recommendation `safe_after_minor_patch`.
- Architecture-boundary pass attachment
  `C:\Users\vmon7\.codex\attachments\bf9f5a34-557c-457a-8aed-9c584bd6401b\pasted-text.txt`,
  SHA256 `11B99696EDAADFB21A83C6817FD8FB7D7241CCABB310DA3B011782CEE32427E9`,
  verdict `ACCEPT_LANE_LOCAL`.
- `docs/prompts/hygiene-queue/precompact_lane_local_delta_acceptance_decision.md`,
  SHA256 `C0CCD2BCA8D8B4709813F80B9D87816918014433E587326CD4BCADF568860E54`.

The architecture pass established three binding conditions for safe acceptance:

- B1: input, not basis.
- B2: acceptance carries its own non-authorization voice.
- B3: hash-bound, patch-only attestation.

This decision applies those three conditions.

## Accepted Scope

Accepted scope:

- The delta at SHA256
  `43B7903ED3A173A17CC8C9C71780F43158744932A3BF5A72B9C3178F4F4DB302` is
  admitted as reviewed lane-local input to one docs-only,
  non-implementation source-observability requirements-boundary decision.
- The allowed decision topic is whether to carry forward a bounded requirements
  boundary for:
  - source-language and visible source-structure preservation;
  - source-language anchors from the start;
  - modality-triggered screenshot, media, or layout preservation where source
    meaning depends on visual presentation;
  - archive availability, archive-body retrieval state, and non-retrieval
    reason visibility.
- This acceptance also records that the prior all-slot synthesis is stale on
  Slot 3 posture and media/visible-envelope facts, while its central
  source-observability conclusion remains strengthened rather than overturned.

## Non-Scope

This acceptance does not make the delta, the prior all-slot synthesis, or
`docs/product/data_capture_spine_source_observability_requirements_scoping_v0.md`
the governing requirements basis.

This acceptance does not settle RQ-01 through RQ-05 as durable requirements.
The requirements basis exists only if a separate owner-accepted requirements
decision creates it.

This acceptance does not amend:

- the Data Capture obligation contract;
- the source-access method plan;
- the Data Capture / ECR / Cleaning / Judgment boundary;
- the source-access boundary;
- any Orca overlay source;
- any validation, review, workflow, lifecycle, or output authority.

## Acceptance-Level Non-Authorization

This acceptance admits the delta only as lane-local input to open one narrow
docs-only, non-implementation source-observability requirements-boundary
decision.

It authorizes no build and no source action: no implementation, tooling,
packages, scrapers, APIs, browser automation, archive automation, recapture
automation, or new source-access capability. "Source-observability" here is a
requirements topic, not permission to reach or capture sources.

It amends no controlling source: not the source-access method plan, the
obligation contract, the Capture / ECR / Cleaning / Judgment boundary, or any
RQ. Those require separate owner authorization naming that scope.

It is not validation, readiness, review approval, ECR authorization, Cleaning
authorization, Judgment authorization, source-of-truth promotion, buyer proof, or
commercial readiness.

The only next content step supported by this acceptance is the requirements
decision itself. Any move toward implementation, tooling, source access,
method-plan amendment, contract amendment, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, validation,
readiness, buyer proof, or commercial readiness is out of scope until separately
authorized.

## Hash-Bound Patch-Only Attestation

The adversarial review verified the pre-patch delta at SHA256
`3526136ECBBA3090B5ADD63FCEF28C65D680C6C45001C9BC927F6367616F4081`.

The accepted delta is the post-patch object at SHA256
`43B7903ED3A173A17CC8C9C71780F43158744932A3BF5A72B9C3178F4F4DB302`.

This acceptance attests that the post-review delta differs from the reviewed
object only by:

- AR-D01 required stale boundary-hash patch;
- AR-D02 clarity patch to the delta result token;
- AR-D03 checker-comparability clarity patch;
- AR-D04 method-plan-candidate guard;
- status, stale wording, and validation-readback bookkeeping needed to reflect
  the reviewed-and-patched state.

This acceptance attests that those post-review edits did not expand scope,
authorization, claims, requirements basis, implementation authority, source
access, method-plan authority, contract authority, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment,
validation, readiness, buyer proof, or commercial-readiness claims.

## What This Binds

This acceptance binds only:

- the owner and the next agent staging the single source-observability
  requirements-boundary decision;
- the admissibility of the exact reviewed-and-patched delta hash named above as
  decision input;
- the within-lane correction that the older all-slot synthesis is stale on Slot
  3 posture and media/visible-envelope facts.

It does not bind future Orca agents globally. It does not bind unrelated lanes.
It does not create durable doctrine.

## Next Lane

Next lane supported by this acceptance:

- one docs-only, non-implementation source-observability requirements-boundary
  decision.

That decision may decide whether to carry forward a bounded requirements
boundary for the accepted scope above.

That decision must not implement requirements, select tools, run captures,
design source-access methods, amend method plans, amend contracts, or design
ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment behavior.

## Stale And Reopen Triggers

Reopen this acceptance if any of the following occur:

- accepted delta SHA256 changes from
  `43B7903ED3A173A17CC8C9C71780F43158744932A3BF5A72B9C3178F4F4DB302`;
- review report SHA256 changes from
  `C2E894C91ED787D7879579EAA35DF03006F97739F20DE43AC348274D9BB7D544`;
- the post-review delta receives edits outside the patch-only attestation set;
- any pinned input-source hash in the accepted delta drifts before the next
  requirements-boundary decision uses it;
- Slot 3 posture is reopened, downgraded, or materially recaptured again;
- a later artifact reviews, accepts, rejects, or supersedes this delta;
- the next decision draws on the delta beyond the accepted scope;
- the next decision treats this acceptance as requirements basis or
  implementation authorization;
- a later batch shows Capture cannot classify source state without ECR,
  Cleaning, Judgment, runtime machinery, source-quality scoring, or forbidden
  source-access methods.

## No-Propagation Rationale

No direction-change propagation receipt is required for this artifact.

Reason: this decision admits one reviewed artifact as lane-local input to one
future decision. It changes no controlling product, architecture, workflow,
validation, review, output, or lifecycle rule. It updates no obligation, method
plan, boundary, overlay, validation gate, or review authority.

If a later source-observability requirements-boundary decision creates durable
requirements, amends doctrine, or authorizes later implementation or method
work, that later artifact must evaluate the direction-change propagation
contract and carry the propagation receipt or blocker where required.

## Non-Claims

This decision is not validation, readiness, source-of-truth promotion,
pressure-test discharge, Data Capture Spine acceptance, production adequacy,
contract hardening, obligation-contract amendment, source-access method-plan
amendment, runtime authorization, tooling authorization, source-system
authorization, scraper authorization, API authorization, browser-automation
authorization, archive-automation authorization, recapture authorization, schema
authorization, ECR design, Cleaning implementation, Judgment design, buyer
proof, commercial-readiness evidence, or global Orca doctrine.
