# Judgment Spine Gate Ownership Map v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Product artifact
scope: Case-agnostic ownership map for Judgment Spine gates needed before stronger proof, scoring, blind-use, fixture, or judgment-quality claims.
use_when:
  - Checking which source owns a Judgment Spine gate before a case tries to claim a stronger tier.
  - Routing a case from source custody and packet construction toward sealed execution, scoring, reveal, calibration, and closeout.
  - Identifying unowned or blocked gates before a future operating-model or case-specific run path.

## Source-Loading Surface

Purpose: name the owner status and handoff boundary for each case-agnostic
Judgment Spine gate needed before stronger proof, scoring, blind-use, fixture,
or judgment-quality claims.

Use when: a future case, run, memo, deck, fixture, scoring artifact, or review
needs to know which gate is owned, candidate-owned, unowned, or blocked before
claim promotion.

Do not use for: authorizing a model run, scoring a case, admitting a fixture,
validating Judgment Spine, creating buyer proof, or claiming judgment-quality
evidence.

Authority boundary: if this map conflicts with the evidence ladder, Orca
overlay, harness contract, or a case-specific accepted decision, open the
controlling source and treat this map as stale for that gate.

Recheck recipe: recompute the input hashes above and rerun the source-loading
read pack in `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md` before strict gate
ownership, readiness, validation, proof, fixture, scoring, or judgment-quality
claims.

## Owner Status Vocabulary

```yaml
owner_status_values:
  owned:
    meaning: A source-backed owner surface defines the gate, required receipt, and failure effect well enough for a future case to route without inventing ownership.
  candidate_owner:
    meaning: A source-backed surface names the concept, but the exact gate contract or receipt ownership is incomplete.
  unowned:
    meaning: No source-backed owner surface was found in the loaded source pack.
  blocked_owner_decision_required:
    meaning: The gate is required for stronger claims, but current sources do not define a complete owner contract; an owner decision or accepted source patch is required before treating it as owned.
```

## Gate Ownership Map

| Gate ID | Gate | Owner status | Owner surface | Required receipt or artifact | Claim blocked if missing | Handoff boundary | Open owner decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JSG-01 | Source identity and pre-decision status | owned | `core_spine_v0_data_and_cleaning_spine_boundary_v0.md` and `core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_obligation_contract_v0.md` for Data Capture/ECR source identity, raw-observable/inspectability, timing, actor, cutoff/archive, and categorical handoff obligations; `packing_to_harness_foundation_interface_architecture_v3.md` for final Judgment-owned `pre_decision_status` | Source-identity and final pre-decision receipt complete per the owning Data Capture/Core Spine contracts and the packing interface; this map must not enumerate the owner fields locally | Judgment-quality evidence, fixture admission, scoring, clean blind-use readiness | Data Capture/ECR preserve source identity and categorical handoff posture; Judgment/Harness consumes and blocks if missing | none for ownership; case-specific source gaps remain possible |
| JSG-02 | Participant packet freeze | owned | Evidence ladder receipt; product-proof zero-spoiler boundary for participant-facing surfaces; `packing_to_harness_foundation_interface_architecture_v3.md` | Participant-packet freeze receipt complete per the evidence ladder, product-proof zero-spoiler boundary for participant-facing surfaces, and packing interface participant-visible boundary; this map must not enumerate the owner-owned spoiler list locally | Clean blind judgment, scoring, fixture admission, judgment-quality evidence | Packing/case artifact authors packet; Harness consumes frozen hash and blocks rather than repairs | none for ownership |
| JSG-03 | Facilitator ledger freeze | owned | Evidence ladder receipt; `band_input_labeling_rubric.md`; `packing_to_harness_foundation_interface_architecture_v3.md` | Frozen `FacilitatorLedger` receipt complete per the packing interface's frozen-ledger requirements and the band-input labeling rubric, including any rubric quarantine handling; this map must not enumerate ledger fields locally | Scoring, fixture admission, judgment-quality evidence | Facilitator ledger owns labels and freeze; Harness consumes and verifies | none for ownership |
| JSG-04 | No-tools isolation | owned | `contestant_no_tools_execution_contract_v0.md` | No-tools execution receipt complete per the contestant no-tools execution contract, including its owner-required isolation result and auditable execution-provenance boundary | Clean blind-use readiness, scoring, validation, fixture admission, judgment-quality evidence | Execution surface or runner receipt proves isolation; prompt text alone is insufficient | none for ownership |
| JSG-05 | Memorization probe | owned | `memorization_probe_protocol.md` paired with no-tools execution contract | Memorization probe artifact complete per the memorization probe protocol and the no-tools execution contract, including the owner-defined gate interpretation and execution-provenance boundary | Contestant-case pair cannot clear model-family gate; clean blind-use readiness remains blocked | Probe protocol owns recognition semantics; no-tools contract owns isolation layer | none for ownership |
| JSG-06 | Sealed blind judgment output | owned | Evidence ladder receipt; product-proof blind-judgment lane; no-tools execution contract blind judgment section | Sealed blind-judgment receipt complete per the evidence ladder, product-proof blind-judgment lane, and no-tools blind-judgment contract, with the JSG-04 dependency satisfied; seal-before-reveal ordering remains checked through JSG-08's owner receipt | Scoring, calibration, fixture admission, judgment-quality evidence | Execution receipt proves clean run; case record preserves seal before reveal | none for ownership |
| JSG-07 | Scoring result | owned | Evidence ladder receipt; `phase_1_infrastructure_architecture.md`; `packing_to_harness_foundation_interface_architecture_v3.md`; scorer-produced `ScoringResult` / `FailureEvent` outputs | Scoring receipt complete per the evidence ladder, phase-1 infrastructure architecture, packing interface, and scorer-produced output contracts, including the owner-required deterministic scoring, version/hash, frozen-input, and failure-event requirements; this map must not define its own re-derivation check locally | Fixture admission, judgment-quality evidence, score-based calibration claims | Harness owns deterministic scoring; it must not author labels, repair missing inputs, or let blocking owner-produced failure events clear as a clean score | none for ownership |
| JSG-08 | Reveal or calibration record | owned | `judgment_spine_reveal_calibration_owner_contract_v0.md`, with product-proof zero-spoiler/outcome-calibration lane boundaries and case-specific reveal/calibration artifacts | Case-specific `jsg_08_reveal_calibration_receipt` complete per the reveal/calibration owner contract's Required Receipt Fields and satisfaction states; this map must not enumerate receipt fields locally | Completed judgment-quality evidence, calibration-based scoring claims, fixture-readiness claims when the case-specific receipt is absent, reveal-only, qualitative-only, or contaminated | Owner contract defines receipt shape; case artifacts own case-specific reveal facts and calibration; JSG-07 still owns scoring results | none for ownership; case-specific receipt gaps remain possible |
| JSG-09 | Claim classification | owned | Evidence ladder `judgment_spine_claim_classification`; validation gate; product-proof boundary | Inline classification or durable co-referenced classification record complete per the evidence ladder's `judgment_spine_claim_classification` schema; this map must not enumerate classification fields locally | Proof, readiness, validation, fixture admission, scoring, blind-use, or judgment-quality claims above the ladder-owned cap for the classified state | Classified artifact must embed or co-reference the classification | none for ownership |
| JSG-10 | Closeout state | owned | Evidence ladder closeout-state vocabulary; validation gate | Named `closeout_state` and `claim_cap` recorded per the ladder closeout vocabulary, the ladder's per-`closeout_state` cap rule, and the weakest-cleared-gate rule where applicable; this map must not collapse every state to weakest-cleared | Any stronger claim than the named closeout state permits | Evidence ladder owns vocabulary; classified artifact records state | none for ownership |

## JSG-08 Owner Detail

`JSG-08` is promoted to `owned` for owner-surface routing only.

`judgment_spine_reveal_calibration_owner_contract_v0.md` now defines the
case-agnostic receipt shape, satisfaction states, reveal-readout boundary,
calibration-frame boundary, scoring relationship, and claim caps for
`outcome_reveal_or_calibration_record`.

This does not clear the gate for any case. A case-specific artifact must still
record whether its receipt is `absent`, `reveal_readout_only`,
`qualitative_outcome_calibration`, `score_linked_outcome_calibration`, or
`contaminated_or_invalid`. Reveal-only material remains case-learning or
product-learning context and cannot support completed judgment-quality evidence,
scoring readiness, fixture admission, or validation.

`JSG-09` and `JSG-10` are owned for classification and closeout recording only.
They cannot record `completed_judgment_quality_evidence` unless the
case-specific `JSG-08` receipt has a status strong enough for the claim and all
other required gates also clear. The classification or closeout must name the
missing or insufficient `JSG-08` receipt or use a lower ladder closeout state.

    Round-16 patch (2026-06-04): the JSG-02 required-receipt cell now references

    cell now routes to scorer-produced ScoringResult/FailureEvent outputs and the
    owner scoring contracts for failure-event handling, and explicitly forbids
    the map from defining its own re-derivation check. This aligns the map with

    spoiler leak or versioned/hash-bearing score with blocking owner-produced
    failure events cannot be treated as a clean gate receipt. No new claim tier
    or closeout_state is minted.
