## 1. Commission And Bindings

| Binding | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Commissioned target | `docs/product/source_capture_toolbox/source_quality_state_assembler_v0.md` (primary) plus its README, source-loading, and repo-map navigation/propagation surfaces. |
| Commissioned purpose | Confirm the rename away from "conductor," the read-only state-census boundary, fake-success guardrails, operator-finalized `mini_god_tier_met`, proportional navigation updates, propagation-receipt honesty, and safety as architecture basis before implementation scoping. |
| Workspace | `C:\Users\vmon7\Desktop\projects\orca` |
| Branch / HEAD | `main` / `6cd8a95` (per prompt; worktree dirty). |
| Edit permission | read-only. No artifact patched. |
| Output mode | `filesystem-output`; `required_output_path` = this file. |
| Result vocabulary | Commission-supplied severity (`blocking`/`major`/`minor`/`advisory`) and verdict (`accept` … `blocked`). Used as the requested output shape, not an overlay-bound source-of-truth verdict. |
| Dirty-state allowance | Broad repo dirty state allowed; four targets intentionally dirty/untracked. |

### Hash Gate

All four target SHA256 hashes were recomputed and **MATCH** the expected values (table in `input_hashes`). The review is anchored to those exact bytes. No `HASH_MISMATCH`.

### Deep-Thinking Discipline

`workflow-deep-thinking` was invoked before source preflight and applied throughout: the accepted architecture decision was treated as the bar, the brief's positive allowances and negative prohibitions were each tested for authority leakage and fake-success bypass, and helper/profile claims were checked against actual source rather than accepted on assertion. A high-risk verification pass (architecture-bearing, cross-lane) re-checked the verdict against anchoring on the first reading of each ambiguity; it downgraded two candidate "major" items (helper-invocation ambiguity, `ready_for_tool_run` adjacency) to minor after confirming the read-only/operator-finalized safety envelope holds under either resolution.

## 2. Source-Read Ledger

| Source | Why read | Status | Supports |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent kernel + Orca authority + doctrine-change rule | dirty (modified) | Authority boundary, DCP requirement |
| `.agents/workflow-overlay/README.md` | Overlay binding rule | dirty (modified) | Overlay precedence |
| `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md` | Source hierarchy + DCP receipt contract | dirty (modified) | AR-04 receipt evaluation |
| `.agents/workflow-overlay/retrieval-metadata.md` | Retrieval-header contract | read at worktree | Header compliance check |
| `docs/product/source_capture_toolbox/source_quality_state_assembler_v0.md` | Primary target | **verified hash**, untracked | All findings |
| `docs/product/source_capture_toolbox/README.md` | Target (nav + component index) | **verified hash**, dirty | AR-02 |
| `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md` | Target (read-pack route) | **verified hash**, dirty | Q6 proportionality |
| `docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md` | Target (navigation) | **verified hash**, dirty | Q6 proportionality |
| `…/source_quality_mini_god_tier_profile_v0.md` | Source basis: criteria, tokens, lifecycle | read at worktree | Q2, Q5, AR-05 |
| `…/source_quality_source_unit_queue_template_v0.md` | Source basis: row-status vocabulary | read at worktree | Q5, AR-03 |
| `orca-harness/docs/source_capture_agent_runbook.md` | Source basis: helper/runner operating rules | read at worktree | AR-01, Q3 |
| `orca-harness/source_capture/source_quality.py` | Source basis: actual helper behavior | read at worktree | Q3, Q5 (code-verified) |
| `docs/product/judgment_quality_promotion_operating_model_v0.md` | Pattern reference only | read at worktree | Q1 (conductor pattern fidelity) |
| `docs/research/judgment-spine/judgment_spine_thesis_operating_contract_v0.md` | Pattern reference only | read at worktree | Q1, Q8 (Judgment-boundary non-import) |
| `docs/product/judgment_spine_toolkit_blocker_specs_from_daimler_source_fanout_v0.md` | Pattern reference only | read at worktree | Q8 (later-stage Judgment scope kept out) |

**Dirty-source note.** Every authority and source-basis file is read at current (dirty) worktree state. This is an advisory review (no overlay binds a formal artifact-role verdict vocabulary), so dirty state is acceptable; the four strict target claims are anchored to verified SHA256 hashes. Judgment sources were treated as pattern references only, never as Source Capture authority, per the commission.

---

## 3. Gate Results

- **Trigger gate:** PASS. The commission explicitly names `workflow-adversarial-artifact-review` and an artifact-review target.
- **Lane-collision resolver:** PASS / single lane. The targets are non-code docs artifacts. `source_quality.py` was read only as source basis to verify the brief's claims; its implementation correctness is **not** reviewed in this lane (that is the implementation-review lane). No `BLOCKED_LANE_COLLISION`.
- **Artifact-role preflight:** Advisory critique mode. No overlay binds a formal artifact-role verdict for this target, so formal pass/fail status is `not proven`; findings are decision input. Retrieval-header compliance of the brief checked (see Q6 / closure).
- **Validation-gate status:** Not applicable / none bound. This is a docs-only architecture boundary; no executable validation gate is in scope. No red-green proof applies to these findings (all are source-support/boundary/wording, marked `not_applicable` for test-shaped proof).
- **Output-mode preflight:** PASS. `filesystem-output` with bound `required_output_path`; directory confirmed present; durable write performed and re-read (Section 8).

### Review Scope

In scope: the four target files' claims, boundaries, vocabulary, navigation updates, and the brief's `direction_change_propagation` receipt, judged against the accepted architecture decision and the source-basis artifacts.

Excluded: implementation correctness of `source_quality.py` or any runner; admission/validation/scoring of any packet; Judgment-Spine doctrine; and any patch execution (none authorized).

---

## 4. Phase 1 — Correctness Findings

### AR-01 (minor, correctness) — "Surface the helper's output" vs "must not launch any Source Capture runner" is unresolved for implementation scoping

- **Anchor:** brief Accepted-flow line "report-skeleton helper output surfaced verbatim"; Core Responsibilities "surface the helper's `suggested_result_token` … without strengthening them"; Forbidden Responsibilities "launch any Source Capture runner."
- **Source authority:** `source_capture_agent_runbook.md` ("The helper is local and deterministic. It reads existing packet manifest and packet-side metadata only"); `source_quality.py` (`build_source_quality_report_skeleton` is read-only over an existing manifest).
- **Evidence / impact:** The brief frames helper output as an input that is *surfaced* (i.e., already produced), which is the read-only reading. But it never states whether the assembler may itself **invoke** the report-skeleton helper (which lives in `orca-harness/runners/`) per row, or must consume already-emitted helper output. An implementation scoper could read "may surface the helper's `suggested_result_token`" as license to call `run_source_quality_report_skeleton.py` across rows — i.e., per-row helper dispatch, which is exactly the sequencer/dispatch connotation the rename was meant to shed (Q8 "imply … runner dispatch").
- **Why not major/blocking:** The report-skeleton helper is itself read-only and never acquires sources, scores, admits, or finalizes `mini_god_tier_met`. So even the looser reading keeps the assembler inside the read-only / operator-finalized safety envelope; the artifact is safe to *use* and safe to *scope*. This is a precision gap, not a safety hole.
- **minimum_closure_condition:** The brief states explicitly that the assembler consumes already-produced report-skeleton output, OR — if invoking the read-only report-skeleton helper is intended — carves that single read-only helper out of the "Source Capture runner" prohibition so the two clauses do not contradict.
- **next_authorized_action:** Author (overlay-authorized docs-write lane) may add one clarifying sentence; resolve at the start of implementation scoping.
- **patch_queue_entry:** not overlay-authorized in this commission. Red-green proof: `not_applicable`.

### AR-02 (minor, correctness) — README lists the assembler architecture boundary under "Implemented first-tranche pieces," risking a built-vs-planned overclaim

- **Anchor:** `README.md` → "## Overall Gaps" → "Implemented first-tranche pieces:" → "Source Quality State Assembler architecture boundary for a read-only multi-row state census over existing packets." Secondary: brief Purpose "The Source Quality State Assembler **exists to** make that target repeatable."
- **Source authority:** brief Status ("records the architecture boundary for a **possible** Source Quality State Assembler … not an implementation plan and not implementation authorization"); README component section ("define the architecture boundary for a **future** read-only helper").
- **Evidence / impact:** The "Implemented first-tranche pieces" list otherwise contains actual code/docs (packet writer, Direct HTTP adapter, the **implemented** report-skeleton helper). The assembler is the only docs-only architecture-boundary item in that list. The qualifier "architecture boundary" mitigates it and the dedicated component section is accurate, but a skim-level reader could infer an assembler tool exists. For an artifact whose purpose is preventing overclaim, a docs-only boundary sitting under an "Implemented" header is a soft self-contradiction.
- **minimum_closure_condition:** The README distinguishes the produced architecture-boundary *doc* from implemented *tooling* (e.g., move the line out of "Implemented … pieces," or tag it "architecture boundary only; no assembler tool implemented yet"). Optionally soften brief "exists to" to "is intended to."
- **next_authorized_action:** Patch the README wording before committing the dirty target files.
- **patch_queue_entry:** not overlay-authorized. Red-green proof: `not_applicable`.

### AR-03 (minor, correctness) — "Propose queue workflow state" is dispatch-adjacent for `ready_for_tool_run`; guardrails cover `reported` auto-advance but not this

- **Anchor:** brief Core Responsibilities "propose queue workflow state only from the queue template's existing row-status vocabulary"; Forbidden Responsibilities guards "auto-advance a row to `reported`" and "mint … row-status tokens" but is silent on asserting `ready_for_tool_run`.
- **Source authority:** `source_quality_source_unit_queue_template_v0.md` — `ready_for_tool_run` = "Required runner inputs are present and no visible stop is known," and the fill rule "Do not mark a row `ready_for_tool_run` unless the exact runner input is present and the runner is authorized."
- **Evidence / impact:** A read-only census echoing a row's *existing recorded* `row_status` is benign. But "propose queue workflow state" could be read as the assembler *computing* `ready_for_tool_run` — a "ready to dispatch" assertion — which is adjacent to the runner-dispatch boundary the rename was meant to avoid (Q8). The asymmetry (auto-advance to `reported` is forbidden, asserting `ready_for_tool_run` is not) is the gap.
- **Why not major:** It remains a state observation surfaced to the operator, who still decides dispatch; the assembler still cannot launch a runner. Safety envelope holds.
- **minimum_closure_condition:** The brief clarifies that the assembler surfaces/echoes the row's existing `row_status` and never asserts dispatch-readiness as authorization (or extends the "auto-advance" guardrail to `ready_for_tool_run`).
- **next_authorized_action:** Resolve alongside AR-01 at implementation scoping; optional one-line clarification before commit.
- **patch_queue_entry:** not overlay-authorized. Red-green proof: `not_applicable`.

### AR-04 (minor, correctness) — `direction_change_propagation` receipt is structurally valid but under-evidenced

- **Anchor:** brief `direction_change_propagation` block — `stale_language_search:` present with no `stale_language_search_result:`; `downstream_surfaces_checked:` omits `CLAUDE.md`; `intentionally_not_updated:` omits `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Source authority:** `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md` — propagation contract: "consider … top-level agent instructions such as `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`." Two adjacent receipts in the same source tree (source-of-truth's own DCP receipt; the judgment-quality conductor) both include an executed `stale_language_search_result`.
- **Evidence / impact:** (a) The receipt declares a stale-language query but records no executed result, so a reader cannot confirm the search ran or that no residual "conductor"/authority language leaks — the most load-bearing check for a *rename-away-from-conductor* change. (b) `CLAUDE.md` is named by the contract as a surface to consider but appears in neither checked nor intentionally-not-updated lists. The canonical receipt shape does not strictly *require* `stale_language_search_result`, so the receipt is structurally complete; this is an honesty/completeness gap, not a missing mandatory field. `CLAUDE.md` is provably low-impact here (thin shim subordinate to `AGENTS.md`; encodes no Source Capture component status) but should be recorded as intentionally-not-updated for a complete receipt.
- **minimum_closure_condition:** Add an executed `stale_language_search_result` (showing the rg query's hits are expected vocabulary/navigation and no residual conductor-authority leak), and record `CLAUDE.md` as checked/intentionally-not-updated with a one-line reason.
- **next_authorized_action:** Complete the receipt before committing the dirty target files.
- **patch_queue_entry:** not overlay-authorized. Red-green proof: `not_applicable`.

## 5. Phase 2 — Friction Findings

No material operator friction worth a finding. The brief's repetition of prohibitions across Do-Not-Use-For, Forbidden Responsibilities, the Fake-Success table, Output Boundary, and Non-Claims is defensible defense-in-depth for a boundary artifact and does not increase operator error, review cost, or drift.

### AR-05 (advisory, correctness/consistency) — Mini God-Tier Purpose paraphrase drops two of the profile's six criteria

- **Anchor:** brief Purpose — "best in-bound body possession plus visible provenance, cutoff, modality, limitation, and lifecycle posture."
- **Source authority:** `source_quality_mini_god_tier_profile_v0.md` — six required criteria: best in-bound body possession; identity/provenance; **source-language anchors**; **coverage or drift note**; visible limitations; lifecycle state.
- **Evidence / impact:** The paraphrase omits source-language anchors and coverage/drift, slightly under-representing the target. Risk is low (the brief routes to the profile via `open_next`, and the surfaced helper `operator_completion_required` re-raises anchors and coverage), but it is mild "restate" drift against the brief's own "route, don't restate" discipline, and it makes the smallest-complete target read as smaller than it is.
- **minimum_closure_condition:** Reference the profile's six criteria (or name all six) rather than an abbreviated five-ish list.
- **next_authorized_action:** Optional follow-up patch; not required before use.
- **patch_queue_entry:** not overlay-authorized. Red-green proof: `not_applicable`.

## 6. Review Questions — Adversarial Answers

1. **Rename / conductor authority leakage — PASS.** Title and body adopt "Source Quality State Assembler"; the brief states the avoidance of "conductor" explicitly and why (gate-sequencer/authority connotation). No gate-sequencing, receipt-verifying, or advance/halt authority is asserted; the allowed flow ends in operator finalization + state census. Residual "assembler/**router**" framing is retained but bounded to "routes quality-bearing conclusions **back to the operator**" (deferral, not sequencing), consistent with the borrowed route-don't-restate pattern — acceptable; could optionally be trimmed to "assembler." No hard leak.
2. **Mini God-Tier as smallest-complete — PASS.** The brief states Mini God-Tier is "smallest complete … not maximal collection," matching the profile ("stronger than a packet was written … weaker than full formal evidence admission"). Validation is explicitly disclaimed. See AR-05 for a minor paraphrase looseness (not a maximal-collection or validation drift).
3. **Fake-success paths — PASS (strong).** All seven named vectors carry an explicit guardrail (Fake-Success table), plus an eighth (Judgment-authority import). Two guardrails were code-verified against `source_quality.py`: `result_token_finalization` is hard-set to `operator_review_required` and empty limitations emit `"none_observed_in_manifest; operator_review_required still applies"` (empty ≠ clean pass); metadata-only/not-preserved bodies yield `archive_body_not_preserved` / `body_possession_not_proven` (packet/metadata existence ≠ body possession). `_test_runs/` scratch boundary is preserved and matches the repo-map gitignored-scratch list.
4. **State census vs verdict — PASS.** "Combined output … is a state census, not a verdict"; must keep per-row tokens/limitations/lifecycle/operator-completion visible; "no green rollup, no 'all rows passed', no ladder completion claim." Output Boundary forbids validated/ready/admitted/complete/scored/Judgment-useful/buyer-proof/commercially-ready.
5. **`mini_god_tier_met` operator-finalized — PASS (code-verified).** Forbidden: "finalize `mini_god_tier_met` by automation" and "auto-advance a row to `reported`." The helper never suggests `mini_god_tier_met` (its three suggested tokens are with-visible-limitations / archive-body-not-preserved / body-possession-not-proven) and always emits `result_token_finalization: operator_review_required`. Met-ness can only come from operator finalization.
6. **Navigation updates proportional / non-overclaiming — MOSTLY PASS.** README controlling-sources row, README component section, source-loading read-pack entry (line ~339) and prose summary, and repo-map Core-Spine + pressure-test pointers are each boundary-qualified ("state census only, not source discovery, runner dispatch, scoring, fixture admission, or Judgment authority") and proportional. Exception: README "Implemented first-tranche pieces" (AR-02).
7. **Propagation receipt complete and honest — MOSTLY PASS.** Valid trigger (`architecture_doctrine`) + related_triggers (`output_authority`, `product_doctrine`); `controlling_sources_updated` lists exactly the four changed targets; `intentionally_not_updated` reasons are honest and verified (profile, queue template, runbook, and `source_quality.py` genuinely unchanged; Judgment files referenced as pattern only). Gaps: no executed `stale_language_search_result` and `CLAUDE.md` not recorded (AR-04).
8. **Any wording authorizing/implying forbidden actions — PASS, with two adjacencies.** No positive authorization for source discovery, runner dispatch, acquisition, fixture admission, scoring, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, validation, readiness, or buyer proof — all are explicitly forbidden/non-claimed across multiple sections. Two adjacencies that *imply* nothing unsafe but should be tightened: helper-invocation ambiguity (AR-01) and `ready_for_tool_run` proposal (AR-03).
9. **Required downstream surfaces missing — MINOR.** `CLAUDE.md` (contract-named) is the one surface not recorded as checked/intentionally-not-updated (AR-04). All code/runner surfaces are correctly excluded (docs-only change); `artifact_retrievability_guide.md` is correctly included; the four changed targets are correctly listed as controlling sources.
10. **Safe as architecture basis before implementation scoping — YES.** Read-only, docs-only, implementation explicitly disclaimed, boundary internally consistent, fake-success guardrails code-verified, Judgment referenced as pattern only. All findings are minor/advisory; none creates a fake-success path or authorizes a forbidden action. Resolve AR-01 and AR-03 at the start of implementation scoping so per-row helper dispatch / dispatch-readiness assertion are not silently introduced; patch AR-02 and AR-04 before committing the four dirty target files.

---

## 7. Not-Proven Boundaries / Strict-Only Blockers

This review does not establish, and the artifact does not become, any of: validation; readiness; source-of-truth promotion; implementation authorization; fixture admission; source-quality scoring; source discovery; source acquisition; runner-dispatch authorization; ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment output; buyer proof; or commercial readiness. No overlay-bound formal artifact-role verdict was available; the severity/verdict vocabulary is commission-supplied and the findings are decision input, not mandatory remediation. No patch queue is emitted (executor routing not overlay-authorized for this commission); remediation directions above are advisory prose only.

---

## 8. Durable Write Verification

The report was written to the bound `required_output_path` and re-read; the verifying read's actual output is recorded in the chat courier. The report itself is a review output, not a doctrine change, and carries no `direction_change_propagation` receipt of its own.

---

## 9. Review-Use Boundary

These findings are decision input for the artifact owner / Chief Architect, not mandatory instructions. Only a separately authorized patch, acceptance, validation, or implementation lane can make any remediation mandatory or executor-ready. The recommended verdict is `accept_with_minor_patches`: the Source Quality State Assembler v0 boundary is safe to use as architecture basis now; apply the four minor patches (AR-02 and AR-04 before committing the dirty targets; AR-01 and AR-03 as implementation scoping begins) and optionally AR-05.
