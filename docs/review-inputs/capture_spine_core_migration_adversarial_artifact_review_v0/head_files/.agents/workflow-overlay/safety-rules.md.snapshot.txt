# Safety Rules

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Orca overlay authority
scope: Project-specific safety rules, forbidden drift, authorization boundaries, and rollback limits for Orca work.
use_when:
  - Checking whether an action is forbidden drift or needs explicit authorization (implementation, runtime, commit, push, external-folder, or skill edits).
  - Confirming fail-visible behavior, scope discipline, or rollback boundaries before acting.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
```

## Project-Specific Safety

- Fail visibly when required Orca authority is missing.
- Do not substitute `jb` paths, product facts, lifecycle rules, or validation gates.
- Do not create software implementation, runtime systems, packages, tests, deployed automation, or source-system buildout unless the current turn or an accepted Orca decision explicitly authorizes a bounded implementation scope.
- Bounded implementation authorization is not blanket runtime authority. Stay inside the named scope, preserve the bounded third-tranche scope for anti-detect/proxy/JS-challenge work, and preserve separate gates for commercial fetch services, storage, dashboards, deployment, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, commits, pushes, and PRs.
- Do not mutate external reference folders during import planning.
- Do not edit installed global skills, user-level skills, plugin cache files, or external workflow source unless a later turn explicitly authorizes it.
- Orca-local candidate skill drafting or iteration may proceed only through the
  controlled lane in `.agents/workflow-overlay/skill-adoption.md`. That lane
  does not authorize global, user-level, plugin, installed, or external workflow
  source mutation.
- Do not configure remotes or perform destructive cleanup unless explicitly authorized. Commit, push, and pull-request preparation follow the work-unit completion rule in `AGENTS.md`: at the verified completion of a repo-changing work unit on the lane's own branch or worktree they proceed without a typed instruction, owner-gated by the `settings.json` permission prompts; landing to `main` stays human-gated except a guard-verified self-merge of the agent's own PR (every other state fails closed). The guard (`.agents/hooks/guard_protected_actions.py`) is the enforcement; the conditions and policy live in `docs/decisions/dev_workflow_ci_branch_protection_doctrine_v0.md`.
- **Online/external source-data capture routes through the Source Capture Armory Runner Ladder.** Any capture of online or external source data for evidence or learning goes through the armory runners + Mini God-Tier source-quality discipline (the "Runner Ladder"), not ad-hoc web fetches; captures emit inspectable Source Capture Packets that also serve as Capture-lane data. Route via the repo map (`docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md` -> Data Capture / Source Capture Armory submap) -> `orca-harness/docs/source_capture_agent_runbook.md` + `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/source_quality_mini_god_tier_profile_v0.md`. Uncaptured scouting/diagnostic web reads (not entered as evidence) are exempt.

## Scope Discipline

**Smallest complete intervention** -- and the interpretation of any "smallest
complete X" phrasing (fix, patch, edit, rewrite, refactor, review, answer) -- is
defined canonically in `AGENTS.md` § "Smallest Complete Intervention". That
definition is repo-wide and all-agent; this overlay defers to it and does not
restate it. The overlay's only role here is to apply that rule to Orca scope
discipline: bounded intervention, justified adjacency, and no speculative
extras.

## Rollback Boundary

Rollback for this bootstrap is additive: remove the newly created Orca directory only with explicit user approval. No rollback step may edit `jb`, installed skills, user-level skills, plugin skills, or external reference folders.
