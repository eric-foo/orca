## Status

Status: `SOURCE_QUALITY_CW_P1_END_TO_END_PASS_CLOSEOUT_V0`.

This artifact closes a bounded one-source Mini God-Tier source-quality pass for
`CW-P1`. The pass exercised the intended loop:

```text
source-unit queue posture -> packet inspection -> helper skeleton ->
operator-finalized report block -> queue row reported
```

The pass did not discover, select, rank, score, admit, or judge sources. The
packet remains scratch lifecycle evidence under `_test_runs/`, not an admitted
fixture or durable raw-source repository.

## Source-Unit Queue Row

| source_id | case_or_slot | locator | decision_relevance | current_state | target_posture | primary_runner | fallback_runner | cutoff | row_status | result_token | packet_lifecycle | visible_limitations | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CW-P1` | Canoo/Walmart v0.14 source unit | `https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2022/01/05/walmart-to-expand-inhome-delivery-reaching-30-million-u-s-homes-in-2022` | Walmart InHome source unit relevant to the bounded Canoo/Walmart source context; not a relevance ranking or Judgment weight. | Existing Archive.org source-capture packet in scratch. | Cutoff-compatible archive body if available; otherwise metadata-only archive posture carried visibly. | Archive.org runner output already present; no rerun performed. | `none` | `20220701000000` | `reported` | `archive_body_not_preserved` | `scratch` | Archive availability metadata exists, but no eligible archive snapshot body was selected or preserved. | Final token is operator-finalized from packet/metadata inspection, not helper output alone. |

## Packet Evidence Inspected

Packet path:
`orca-harness/_test_runs/source_quality_mixed_trial_20260603_153531/cw_p1_archive`.

Fresh read showed:

```yaml
packet_id: 01KT66HZNVKE39YGJ8X8GBVSBG
source_surface: archive_org_wayback
source_locator: https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2022/01/05/walmart-to-expand-inhome-delivery-reaching-30-million-u-s-homes-in-2022

Preserved files:

| File | Size bytes | SHA256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `raw/01_archive_availability_metadata.json` | 7795 | `55FA3376A6FFABA1146F7E2B9DBDA282601CDEB2CCFC42192866E8D977F97576` |

Source slice:

| slice_id | Preserved files | Access posture | Archive posture | Timing / cutoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `archive_availability` | `file_01` | Archive.org availability HTTP 200. | Availability metadata preserved; no eligible snapshot selected. | Capture time `2026-06-03T07:35:51Z`; snapshot selection constrained at or before `20220701000000`. |

Archive availability metadata:

```yaml
availability_http_status: 200
availability_content_type: application/json
snapshot_count: 13
selected_snapshot: null
earliest_observed_snapshot_timestamp: 20230920050729
cutoff: 20220701000000
```

The availability metadata contains archive rows, but the earliest observed row
is after the cutoff and `selected_snapshot` is null. No archive snapshot body
was preserved.

## Helper Skeleton Output

The report-skeleton helper was run against the packet and wrote:

```text
orca-harness/_test_runs/source_quality_cw_p1_end_to_end_20260603/cw_p1_skeleton.yaml
```

Fresh read showed the helper output:

```yaml
suggested_result_token: archive_body_not_preserved
result_token_finalization: operator_review_required
best_in_bound_body:
  posture: metadata_only
  preserved_body_path: none
  sha256: none
  byte_count: none
  source_or_snapshot_time: earliest observed availability timestamp 20230920050729; no selected snapshot
visible_limitations:
  - Archive availability metadata was preserved, but no archive snapshot body is referenced by source_slices.
  - Archive availability metadata selected_snapshot is null.
  - Archive availability metadata snapshot_count is 13; this is not archive completeness proof.
  - Archive.org snapshot_count, when present, reflects collapse=digest availability rows, not archive completeness proof.
operator_completion_required:
  - review suggested_result_token against the Mini God-Tier profile
  - supply bounded source-language anchors or not_applicable_with_reason
  - supply coverage_or_drift_note
lifecycle_state: scratch
lifecycle_decision_reference: none
```

This is the expected helper behavior. The helper did not treat packet success
or an empty manifest `limitations` array as source-body possession.

  coverage_or_drift_note: standardizes archive availability posture only; does not improve body possession and does not preserve source-language body content.
  visible_limitations:
    - "Archive availability metadata was preserved, but no eligible archive snapshot body was selected or preserved."
    - "Observed snapshot_count was 13, but the earliest observed timestamp was 20230920050729, after cutoff 20220701000000."
    - "selected_snapshot is null in the preserved availability metadata."
    - "Packet manifest limitations were empty, so source-quality classification had to inspect archive/body posture rather than treating exit code 0 as clean capture."
    - "Actor/audience context was not supplied to the Archive.org runner."
    - "The packet is scratch lifecycle output under _test_runs/ and is not a separately admitted fixture."
    - "No source completeness, rights, retention, sensitivity, or Judgment-quality claim is made."
  lifecycle_state: scratch
  lifecycle_decision_reference: none
  non_claims:
    - not validation
    - not source completeness proof
    - not fixture admission unless separately decided
    - not Judgment scoring

## Six-Criteria Check

| Mini God-Tier criterion | CW-P1 result |
| --- | --- |
| Best in-bound body possession | Not met; carried visibly. Availability metadata was preserved, but no eligible archive snapshot body was selected or preserved. |
| Identity and provenance | Satisfied for metadata-only posture. Original locator, CDX availability locator, HTTP status, content type, capture time, metadata byte count, and metadata SHA256 are visible. |
| Source-language anchors | Not applicable with reason. No source body was preserved, so source-language anchors must not be invented from metadata. |
| Coverage or drift note | Satisfied for failure posture. The pass standardizes archive availability posture only and does not improve body possession. |
| Visible limitations | Satisfied. No selected snapshot, after-cutoff availability rows, scratch lifecycle, empty-manifest-limitations risk, and non-claim limits are explicit. |
| Lifecycle state | Satisfied. Lifecycle is `scratch`; no separate fixture admission is implied. |

## Pass Finding

The CW-P1 pass confirms the Mini God-Tier loop works end to end for the
metadata-only failure path:

1. the queue row represented the bounded source unit without discovering or
   ranking sources;
2. packet inspection confirmed archive availability metadata, not source-body
   possession;
3. the skeleton helper preserved conservative behavior and suggested
   `archive_body_not_preserved`;
4. operator completion preserved `not_applicable_with_reason` for
   source-language anchors instead of inventing anchors from metadata;
5. row status reached `reported` only after the final report block existed.

No helper code change or result-token vocabulary change is required from this
pass.

## Friction

- The packet is under `_test_runs/`, so future strict source-quality claims
  depend on that scratch packet still being available unless a separate
  fixture-admission or retention decision preserves it durably.
- The manifest `limitations` array is empty even though source-quality
  limitations are real; the helper and operator report must inspect posture
  fields and archive metadata rather than relying on packet limitations alone.
- Availability metadata has source-state value, but it is not source-language
  body possession.

## Next Learning

The CW-P1 pass completes the current three-case source-quality ladder:

- `CW-P4`: preserved archive body -> `mini_god_tier_met`;
- `CW-P6`: preserved current official body with limitations ->
  `mini_god_tier_with_visible_limitations`;
- `CW-P1`: archive metadata only -> `archive_body_not_preserved`.

The next highest-value move is to scope a Source Quality Conductor v0 over this
ladder, starting from existing packets before allowing any direct runner calls.

## Non-Claims

This closeout is not validation, readiness, source completeness proof, fixture
admission, rights clearance, retention policy, sensitivity review, source
discovery, source selection, source-quality scoring, Judgment scoring, ECR
design, Cleaning implementation, buyer proof, commercial-readiness evidence,
source-access boundary amendment, or authorization for new adapters, APIs,
crawlers, browser fallback, commercial fetch, or production runtime.
