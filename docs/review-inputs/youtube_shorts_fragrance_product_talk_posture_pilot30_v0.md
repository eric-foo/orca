This pilot asks a narrower question than generic tone: when the creator talks about a product, what transcript-visible stance and product promise frame are they using?

Transcript bodies were read transiently from the existing hard30 data-lake pointers and were not copied into this repo artifact.

## Placement

Canonical durable row data belongs in the data lake derived tree, not in this repo file. This repo artifact is a pilot mirror/receipt for review and prompt iteration only.

Admissible lake promotion is split:

- quote/timestamp-backed product mentions and source-visible commercial signals: `derived/<transcript-packet>/silver__cleaning__product_mentions/<id>` or a sibling Cleaning silver lane under the same raw anchor when the row is not itself a product mention
- product posture, recommendation strength, and claim-frame features: future derived rows only after they carry transcript source pointers and a stable row contract

Do not append this pilot table to silver as-is. The current rows were created from transient transcript reads and do not all satisfy the YouTube spec's CE2/CE9 quote-pointer admission requirement.

## Field Contract

Pilot-only fields:

- `dominant_product_posture`: coarse stance toward the product in transcript-visible product talk.
- `recommendation_strength`: how directly the transcript pushes trial, purchase, or avoidance.
- `claim_frames`: provisional multi-label vocabulary for the product promises or objections used.
- `commercial_context`: transcript-visible commercial posture, separated from the product stance.

These fields are not a benchmark, not inter-rater validated, and not audio tone. They are a probe for whether the product-talk layer is worth expanding.

## Pilot Read

The pilot appears worth one more bounded pass because it separates product stance from video format. For example, `ranked_or_segmented_recommendation` rows split into sparse list-inclusion recommendations, age/price segment recommendations, and brand-sent buying-guide CTAs. Single-product rows split into strong endorsement, qualified/mixed review, and negative guidance.

Do not expand this as a vague tone score. If expanded, keep it as product-talk posture plus claim frames, and keep audio delivery separate.

## Non-Claims

- not buyer proof
- not a sentiment benchmark
- not inter-rater reliability
- not audio tone, energy, pace, volume, or prosody
- not creator-level generalization
- not proof that product-talk posture is worth full instrumentation
- not a claim that transcript-only labels capture sarcasm or delivery reliably
- not canonical durable data-lake row storage

Machine-readable labels are in `docs/review-inputs/youtube_shorts_fragrance_product_talk_posture_pilot30_v0.json`.
