# Orca Import Queue

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Migration queue record
scope: Initial read-only import check for the absent `orca nonrepo` reference path and future import boundary.
use_when:
  - Rechecking whether bootstrap observed any import candidates.
  - Deciding whether a later import needs fresh authorization.
open_next:
  - docs/workflows/orca_bootstrap_record.md
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
```

## Reference Path

- Path checked: `C:\Users\vmon7\Desktop\projects\orca nonrepo`
- Exists: no
- Inspection mode: read-only

## Queue

No import candidates were observed because the reference path was absent.

## Boundary

No files were moved, deleted, copied, renamed, or imported from `orca nonrepo`. Future imports require explicit authorization in a later turn.
