# DCP Receipts Archive

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: DCP receipts archive
scope: Verbatim archive of direction_change_propagation receipts that have cycled out of the two-most-recent inline limit in controlling overlay files.
use_when:
  - Auditing the full propagation history of past doctrine changes.
  - Verifying that a stale-language search term was already handled in a prior receipt.
  - Tracing which surfaces were checked or intentionally skipped for a historical doctrine change.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
```

This file is the single authorized standalone archive for Orca direction_change_propagation receipts that have been moved out of controlling overlay files under the receipt-archiving rule (at most two most-recent receipts inline per controlling file; older receipts move here verbatim). The rule that governs receipt archiving lives in `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md`, Doctrine Change Propagation Contract section. This file carries no source authority, validation evidence, readiness, approval, or lifecycle claims.

    Executed on 2026-06-08 after this patch (this change includes a schema edit,
    so it is not purely additive and the search is required). A separate check
    confirmed the receipt-schema placeholder stale_language_search lives in
    exactly one place (source-of-truth.md), so the additive-only tightening forks
    no copy. Every duplicate/fork hit elsewhere (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md,
    source-loading.md, the repo map, validation-gates.md, and prior DCP receipts)
    already asserts reference-over-copy or no-fork and is consistent with the new
    restatement-integrity rule. No surface retained an instruction to weaken,
    narrow, or freely copy a propagated restatement, and none permitted not_run
    for a non-additive change.

direction_change_propagation:
  doctrine_changed: >
    The repo-mode delegated review-and-patch loop -- cross-vendor delegate runs full-artifact discovery and
    authors the bounded fix; CA adjudicates and independently verifies via class-sweep + byte/scope checks --
    SATISFIES a cross_vendor_discovery independent-review requirement for the patched artifact, so a separate
    standalone post-patch re-scan is not additionally required to clear a downstream leakage gate.
    Proportionality is owner-set by assurance tier (buyer-proof may still require a separate pass;
    product-learning / N-case batch may rely on the delegated pass); the one non-independent sliver (the
    delegate's own edited lines) must be mechanically verifiable and the limitation recorded. Contrasts

    Executed 2026-06-18 after edits. Hits are expected guardrails only: the
    new implementation contract rejects "table of contents" as architecture
    terminology and forbids the Availability Index from calling ECR, SCR,
    Cleaning, Projection, or Judgment; the storage contract states blocker 1 is
    not a runtime implementation closeout and contains the query in this
    receipt; the mechanics map hit is an older receipt non-claim against
    implementation readiness. No hit selects a backend, sidecar, Manifest v2,
    runtime implementation, validation, or readiness.
  non_claims:
    - not validation
    - not readiness
    - not implementation authorization
    - not Manifest v2 selection
    - not sidecar selection
    - not storage-engine selection
```
