# DCP Receipts Archive

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: DCP receipts archive
scope: Verbatim archive of direction_change_propagation receipts that have cycled out of the two-most-recent inline limit in controlling overlay files.
use_when:
  - Auditing the full propagation history of past doctrine changes.
  - Verifying that a stale-language search term was already handled in a prior receipt.
  - Tracing which surfaces were checked or intentionally skipped for a historical doctrine change.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
```

This file is the single authorized standalone archive for Orca direction_change_propagation receipts that have been moved out of controlling overlay files under the receipt-archiving rule (at most two most-recent receipts inline per controlling file; older receipts move here verbatim). The rule that governs receipt archiving lives in `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md`, Doctrine Change Propagation Contract section. This file carries no source authority, validation evidence, readiness, approval, or lifecycle claims.

    Executed on 2026-06-08 after this patch (this change includes a schema edit,
    so it is not purely additive and the search is required). A separate check
    confirmed the receipt-schema placeholder stale_language_search lives in
    exactly one place (source-of-truth.md), so the additive-only tightening forks
    no copy. Every duplicate/fork hit elsewhere (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md,
    source-loading.md, the repo map, validation-gates.md, and prior DCP receipts)
    already asserts reference-over-copy or no-fork and is consistent with the new
    restatement-integrity rule. No surface retained an instruction to weaken,
    narrow, or freely copy a propagated restatement, and none permitted not_run
    for a non-additive change.

direction_change_propagation:
  doctrine_changed: >
    The repo-mode delegated review-and-patch loop -- cross-vendor delegate runs full-artifact discovery and
    authors the bounded fix; CA adjudicates and independently verifies via class-sweep + byte/scope checks --
    SATISFIES a cross_vendor_discovery independent-review requirement for the patched artifact, so a separate
    standalone post-patch re-scan is not additionally required to clear a downstream leakage gate.
    Proportionality is owner-set by assurance tier (buyer-proof may still require a separate pass;
    product-learning / N-case batch may rely on the delegated pass); the one non-independent sliver (the
    delegate's own edited lines) must be mechanically verifiable and the limitation recorded. Contrasts

    Operating Economy reform -- reduce no-value latency without losing any
    defect-catching friction. (1) AGENTS.md adds an "Operating Economy" section
    (act-default on reversible work; the "can I pick a defensible default and
    proceed?" test; the harness permission prompts / protected-action guard ARE
    the irreversibility gate, so no chat double-ask; surface a risky assumption
    [keep] != ask permission for a clear reversible action [cut]; load each skill
    once per thread; pre-build gates and precompact are triggered-only and
    precompact is a thin restore pointer) and refines the kernel "surface
    ambiguity" line accordingly. (2) The orchestrator mandate is NARROWED:
    routine prompts apply the new ~12-line "Orca Prompt Preflight" core inline
    (no skill reload); fused, delegated-review-patch, and novel/cross-lane prompts
    still author through the full workflow-prompt-orchestrator skill. The full
    Required Preflight Fields / Review Prompt Defaults / Output Modes obligations
    are unchanged -- the core is an additive fast-path, not a reduced obligation.
    (3) The existing docs/prompts/** PostToolUse hook (check_prompt_provenance.py,
    config-proposal P5) is evolved to INJECT the preflight core instead of a bare
    "use the orchestrator" pointer -- the real, agent-agnostic enforcement that
    replaces the invoke-ritual; its now-stale strong-mandate message is corrected
    to the narrowed two-depth routing.

    every prompt through the orchestrator" mandate. A whole-repo sweep additionally
    finds restatements under orca/product/** (fragrance satellite, capture and
    commission-board artifacts) saying "author through the orchestrator"; these are
    product-lane artifacts, not doctrine-routing surfaces, and stay valid (the

    docs/prompts/** provenance hook (check_prompt_provenance.py) misses
    paste-ready-chat prompts that never touch disk: by requiring durable prompts
    to touch disk, the hook always fires and injects the preflight (incl. source
    pack / required reads + the Source-Gated Method Contract), so source-loading
    is enforced for every durable prompt. chat-only is reserved for trivial,

    The delegated review-and-patch convention now defines a delegated_code_review_and_patch

    exclusion (the 2026-06-16 "do not stretch this convention to a multi-file code diff" text,
    now rotated to the archive). The sibling mode keeps the code review lane (workflow-code-review,
    deep-thinking first, source-gated) as its review method -- NOT artifact review and not a merge
    of the two -- bounds the patch to an explicitly named multi-file set that cannot silently widen
    (everything outside it flag-only), names validation/test obligations that can fail, and keeps
    patch authority an explicit commission subordinate to the implementation-authorization boundary
    in safety-rules.md / AGENTS.md. All other convention machinery (commission, de-correlation /
    two-bar, repo/no_repo access-mode obligations, CA adjudication of the returned diff before keep,
    NEEDS_ARCHITECTURE_PASS, strict-claim boundary, no runtime-model recommendation) is inherited
    unchanged. Legitimizes the shape practice already ran as a disclosed per-commission deviation

  stale_language_search_result: >
    Executed 2026-06-15. The agent-automerge / opt-in / deliberate-marker hits are all item 7 and item 9
    MECHANISM wording, which item 11 preserves (the bot/guard still act only on labeled PRs; the marker
    stays a deliberate per-PR judgment). No live surface claims the agent never self-applies the label or
    that every PR must wait for the owner, so item 11 forks no existing rule — it is additive and only
    sets the agent's default direction for applying the existing marker. The other opt-in hits are the
    unrelated delegated-review-patch convention. No surface required an edit.
  non_claims:
    - not validation, readiness, or acceptance of any lane's content
    - a behavioral/doctrine rule, NOT code; "live" only insofar as agents follow it
    - grants no new merge authority; item 7's guard and the per-lane authorization are unchanged
    - does not claim auto-landed PRs are correct (CI is a test-suite signal only; main is not deployed and
      a bad merge is reversible by a follow-up PR)
    - not a path-scoped auto-label automation (that deterministic variant is a deferred optional follow-on)

    Flips the auto-merge bot (Decision item 9) from "code-backed, NOT a proven unattended merge" to
    PROVEN: on 2026-06-15 the bot landed PR #121 with no agent session (merged by github-actions[bot]).
    This was unblocked by PR #118, which added actions:read to the workflow permissions — the scope the
    statusCheckRollup -> checkSuite.workflowRun eligibility query needs; before it, every bot run that
    evaluated a labeled PR failed GraphQL "Resource not accessible by integration", so no earlier run had
    actually merged. Updates the two LIVE surfaces (the Status "Unattended auto-merge" bullet and item 9's
    Liveness line); the fail-safe behavior (ineligible PR skipped, never mis-merged) and the
    not-the-server-side-gate framing are unchanged.

    Adds Decision item 12: adopts the up-to-date-before-merge MGT after recurring red push:main CI from
    combination breaks (two independently-green PRs that break combined). Root cause: behind_by==0 is
    enforced only for the bot (item 9), not the in-session guard (item 7 residual) or human/CLI merges.
    Adopted: (1) bot-as-default merge path (routine PRs land via the bot, which enforces up-to-date;
    extends item 11); (2) forward-ref annotation discipline (a branch-only open_next/derived_from link
    must carry "# nonresolving: <reason>", which check_map_links already exempts as debt); (3) a red-main
    detector workflow (.github/workflows/main-red-alert.yml) that opens/auto-closes a single tracking
    issue on push:main red/green. Downgraded O2a (guard behind_by check) and O2b (merge-when-green
    refuse-when-behind); deferred the server-side require-up-to-date gate (O1, 403-blocked). Foregone
    limit named: a raw gh pr merge of a behind PR can still break main — detected fast, not prevented.

    Executed 2026-06-15. Item 9 (now flipped to proven by #127) notes the in-session guard "lacks an
    up-to-date check (documented residual)"; item 12 is consistent with and acts on that note (downgrades
    the guard fix O2a, adopts bot-as-default instead). No live surface claims up-to-date is enforced on
    all paths, so item 12 forks no existing rule — it is additive.
  non_claims:

    Narrows the proven unattended auto-merge bot with deterministic risk routing:
    `pr-risk-router.yml` labels PRs as auto-merge eligible, manual-review
    required, or blocked; `auto-merge.yml` now requires both `agent-automerge`
    and `risk/auto-merge-eligible` and skips manual/blocked PRs. Higher-risk PRs
    get a deterministic merge packet, not automated approval. This narrows the
    earlier label-only unattended path while preserving the non-claim that this
