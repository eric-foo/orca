# IG Reels Capture Cadence And Durability Doctrine (v0)

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: capture-ops cadence/durability design proposal (non-authorizing)
scope: >
  How to run the public IG `/reels/` capture at scale over time for creator-traction
  monitoring: a rate/cadence budget, transient-vs-block response policy, graceful
  degradation, and honest gap recording. Operate within platform limits and fail
  honestly; this is NOT stealth, anti-detection, or evasion guidance.
use_when:
  - Scoping a scheduled multi-creator reels monitoring panel.
  - Deciding retry/backoff and degradation behavior around the per-invocation runner.
  - Checking what produces the timepoints the downstream momentum/Spike-Alert lane consumes.

## Status

`PROPOSAL_RECORDED_V0`. This is a design note, not implementation authority, validation,
readiness, scheduler/runtime selection, or a platform-stability claim. It records the "how"
asked for during the 2026-06-25 IG reels capture lane work; it does not build the scheduler.

## Problem

A **single** `/reels/` capture is already complete and honest: the runner either writes a
clean packet or **fails closed** -- `_detect_ig_block` returns a typed reason (login redirect,
429 "please wait" interstitial, "you've been blocked", challenge route) and the run exits
without writing a garbage packet (exit `5`); other failures exit `3`. What is missing is the
**durability envelope** for running this repeatedly across many creators to produce the
momentum timepoints: how often, how spaced, what to do on a soft failure, and how to degrade
without either hammering the platform or silently dropping data.

This matters because momentum is built from **per-timepoint deltas**, and a timepoint missed
or corrupted at capture time is a **permanent** hole in that creator's series.

## Ownership

This is a **new ops/scheduler lane**, owned by neither Capture nor the Data Lake:

- The Data Lake core contract explicitly **excludes** "downstream scheduling, retry, completion
  gating". The lake only retains write-once raw timepoints and offers them by key.
- The capture runner is **per-invocation** by design and already fails closed; it must stay that
  way (no scheduling/retry inside the runner).

The durability layer is therefore a **thin wrapper around the unchanged runner** plus this
operating doctrine.

## What it is NOT

This is rate-respect and honest degradation, **not** stealth, fingerprint, anti-detection, or
account-evasion guidance. The goal is to operate **within** platform limits and surface failure,
not to circumvent limits or hide automation. Block detection stays a fail-closed honesty
mechanism, never an evasion trigger.

## Design (smallest-complete first)

1. **Rate / cadence budget (doctrine, low lock-in -- do first).**
   - A declared budget: max captures per hour, minimum spacing between captures, and a
     per-creator re-capture interval (the monitoring cadence). The cadence is the knob that
     sets how dense each creator's momentum series is; pick it per the decision question, not
     maximally.
   - Recorded as configuration/doctrine, not hard-coded into the runner.

2. **Transient-vs-block response (reads the signals already emitted).**
   - Exit `5` (hard block: login/429/challenge) -> back off that creator/panel; do **not**
     immediately retry; widen spacing or pause the run. A hard block is a rate signal to slow
     down, never a prompt to retry harder.
   - Exit `3` (transient: timeout, browser/launch error) -> bounded retry with backoff, capped
     attempts.

3. **Graceful degradation.**
   - On a block mid-panel, slow or pause the remaining panel rather than continue at speed.
   - A skipped or blocked creator records an **explicit gap** for that timepoint (so the series
     carries an honest hole), never a silent omission and never a fabricated value.

4. **Thin scheduler wrapper (higher lock-in -- do when a real panel is scheduled).**
   - Enforces 1-3 around the per-invocation runner. The runner itself is unchanged.
   - This is the durable workflow-shape piece; defer it until a concrete panel run justifies the
     lock-in. Until then, the budget doctrine + the runner's existing fail-closed behavior are
     enough for ad-hoc monitoring.

## Relationship to the rest of the pipeline

The durability layer produces the **timepoints**; the Data Lake **retains** them write-once and
serves them by key; a downstream **pre-gold momentum/Spike-Alert lane** diffs them into
"usual-range threshold crossed" candidate records keyed to raw; **Judgment** alone interprets
those (gold). Durability is upstream of all of that -- it only governs how the timepoints are
generated.

## Open owner decisions / blockers

- The concrete cadence numbers (captures/hour, spacing, per-creator interval) -- owner-set per
  the monitoring decision question; this note does not pick them.
- Scheduler/runtime selection -- deferred; not chosen here.
- Whether the gap-recording for a skipped/blocked timepoint is a capture-side artifact or a
  downstream-series-side annotation -- resolve when the momentum lane is scoped.

## Non-claims

- not validation
- not readiness or production-fitness
- not scheduler/runtime/backend selection
- not a platform-stability or block-rate guarantee
- not stealth, anti-detection, or evasion guidance
- not a momentum, demand, credibility, or Judgment claim
