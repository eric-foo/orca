# Orca Repo-Map Architecture (Mini God Tier) v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Orca decision record (owner-invoked mini-god-tier architecture)
scope: >
  The tiered Orca repo-map architecture and the reachability-coverage invariant.
  Binds what the central map owns vs what submaps and retrieval headers own, and
  defines "covered" as a gateable invariant (ancestor-area reachability, NOT
  row-per-folder). Consumed by the coverage checker and the map-rebuild work.
use_when:
  - Building, rebuilding, or gating the repo map / submaps.
  - Defining or changing what folder "coverage" means in check_map_links.
  - Deciding whether a folder needs its own map row (it usually does not).

## Status

Owner-invoked mini-god-tier (MGT) design, 2026-06-19 (this thread; owner said
"make it the MGT" for the repo-map structure). Per
`docs/decisions/orca_mini_god_tier_doctrine_v0.md` this is a **design lens, not a
claim tier** — it asserts no validation or readiness, and its mandatory
named-limitations list is below.

## Decision

The repo map is **high-level authority + a router, not a per-doc index.** Per-doc
indexing is already solved, decentrally, by retrieval headers (they travel with
the doc, die with the doc, and `header_index --index` regenerates the full
per-doc view on demand). A central per-doc enumeration would duplicate that and
churn on every edit — the standing-infrastructure shape MGT rejects.

**God-tier vs MGT (owner-asked 2026-06-19) — split by layer.** The *artifact* is
MGT: decentralized (high-level map + submaps + headers), with the full per-doc
list regenerated on demand by `header_index --index`. The *guarantee* is
god-tier-rigorous: the completeness invariant is **gated** (every durable doc
headered + every folder reachable + zero orphan). A persisted, always-in-sync
complete central index (the god-tier *artifact*) is rejected — in Orca's
multi-lane, about-to-bloat-cut repo it is a merge-conflict magnet and duplicates
the headers, adding nothing over (headers + `--index` + the git PR diff). Rigor
lives in the gate, not the file.

### The three tiers

| Tier | Owns | Churn |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **T1 — the map** (`docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md`) | top-level dirs; the spine axis + **major areas** (one or two levels deep); fast-route Q&A; governance/active-hooks notes; the **submap registry** | only on *structural* change (new spine/area) — stable across the bloat cut |
| **T2 — per-spine submaps** (`docs/workflows/*submap*.md`) | internal routing for **dense** spines only (ECR exists; capture + judgment are the next candidates) | localized to one area |
| **T3 — retrieval headers** (per durable doc) | the per-doc index: role / scope / use_when / open_next | travels with the doc; **zero map churn on delete** |

### Coverage invariant (gateable)

A folder containing durable docs is **covered** iff **it, or an ancestor *area*,
is a canonical map/submap path entry**, enforced down to a **minimum declared
depth** (the spine-area level). A spine-area entry covers its sub-folders;
declaring only a high root (e.g. `orca/product/`) does **not** cover leaves
(that would re-introduce vacuity). Leaf discovery within a covered area is via
the submap (if dense) + retrieval headers.

"Canonical path entry" = a backticked path token in the **first cell** of a map
table row (folder rows and file rows both confer coverage on their containing
area). Prose mentions, answer-cell paths in Q&A tables, and "add X later" debt
notes do **not** confer coverage.

### Named foregone limitations (mandatory — MGT)

1. **No hand-maintained central list of every doc.** Navigation is map → submap
   → header. *Kept value:* `header_index --index` regenerates the full per-doc
   list on demand, so the standing infrastructure is dropped, not the capability.
2. **Coverage guarantees reachability, not explicit per-folder naming.** A folder
   is reached via its area, not a dedicated row.
3. **Submaps add one indirection hop and need their own freshness discipline** (a
   submap registry in T1 + a "registered submaps exist/fresh" check).
4. **The coverage predicate is ancestor-path matching** (segment-aware), slightly
   more code than a substring "is it named" test — but it is the correct predicate.
5. **Index quality depends on header discipline** — already separately gated by
   `header_index`, so not a new risk.

The Pareto bet: accept (1)+(2) as the price; win low-churn + stable-across-bloat
+ zero duplication as the prize.

## Consequences

- **Coverage semantics:** `check_map_links.dir_is_covered` becomes
  **ancestor-area** reachability against canonical first-cell path tokens — NOT
  the raw-substring or descendant-prefix forms. This kills the false-cover cases
  (sibling `foobar`, prose mention, answer-cell path, child-covers-parent).
- **Map-rebuild (W-map) scope shrinks:** from "add a row per uncovered leaf
  folder" to "declare the **area hierarchy** to area-depth + add the capture and
  judgment submaps." The ~34 orca/ "uncovered" leaf folders measured under loose
  matching largely collapse into a bounded set of area entries.
- **C3 folder-coverage and the `header_index` orphan check are complementary,**
  not redundant: the orphan check only fires on header-bearing docs, so C3 still
  catches a folder whose docs lack headers. Both share the one fixed
  `dir_is_covered`.
- **Exemptions** (operational corpus/fixture/source folders that should not be
  governed) route through the versioned waiver registry, exact-path, not pattern
  matching.

## Non-claims

- Design lens only (MGT): not validation, readiness, or proof; no artifact
  currently carries a readiness claim from this record.
- Not the implementation: this binds the target; the coverage-checker rewrite,
  the map rebuild, and the submaps are separate authorized builds.
- Not a claim that the map is currently complete under this invariant — it is the
  target the rebuild converges to.

## Direction Change Propagation

```yaml
direction_change_propagation:
  doctrine_changed: >
    Orca adopts a mini-god-tier tiered repo-map architecture: the central map is
    high-level authority + router (top-level dirs, spine axis + major areas,
    fast-route, governance, submap registry); dense spines get submaps; retrieval
    headers remain the decentralized per-doc index. "Coverage" is redefined as a
    reachability invariant — a folder is covered iff it or an ancestor area is a
    canonical first-cell map/submap path entry (depth-bounded), NOT row-per-folder.
    This supersedes the implicit row/substring coverage model and rescopes the
    coverage checker and the map rebuild.
