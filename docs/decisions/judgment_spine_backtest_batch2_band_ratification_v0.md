# Judgment Spine — Backtest Batch 2 Band Ratification v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Decision record
scope: >
  Owner ratification of the facilitator-set scoring bands (frozen_band_inputs)
  for all 9 Batch 2 product-learning cases. Records the owner's acceptance of
  each case's frozen band as the answer key against which the Claude-Sonnet arm
  (and the forthcoming external arms) are scored. This is an external owner
  sign-off that references each frozen facilitator_ledger by its freeze hash; it
  does NOT mutate the frozen ledgers, change any band, alter any score, or touch
  the pinned scoring key. Caps at product-learning.
use_when:
  - Confirming whether a Batch 2 case's band is owner-ratified before relying on its result.
  - Auditing the owner sign-off chain for the Batch 2 scoring key.

## Status

`BATCH2_BANDS_OWNER_RATIFIED` — a batch-local label, not an evidence-ladder
closeout_state or claim tier. The owner **ratified these bands in-thread
2026-06-16 (Eric)**, directing ratification of the slice-2 cases and accepting
extension to the full 9-case set (see Scope note).

## What this ratifies

The owner accepts each case's facilitator-set `frozen_band_inputs` — and the
deterministic band the pinned key derives from them — as the **scoring key** for
that case. This removes the `owner ratification pending` caveat carried in the
per-case findings. It applies to the already-scored Claude-Sonnet arm and to the
forthcoming external arms (GPT-5.5 / Grok 4 / Gemini), which score against the
same frozen bands.

7 holdouts + 2 dev = 9. Bands are the deterministic output of the pinned key
(`band_scorer.py` / `mapping_table.py`, `input_hashes` above, unchanged) applied
to each ledger's `frozen_band_inputs`; this record ratifies the band inputs, not
a hand-set band.

## Scope note (owner-directed, with disclosed extension)

The owner explicitly directed ratification of the three slice-2 cases (nueco,
cocokind, saie). The other six slice-1 holdout bands were **equally
facilitator-set and equally `owner (pending)`**; a partial 3-of-9 ratification
would leave the batch scoring key half-signed and the findings caveats
inconsistent. The full 9-case set is therefore ratified here under owner
authority for batch-key coherence. The owner may scope this back to the three
slice-2 cases by dated note.

## Mechanism (why the frozen ledgers are not edited)

Each `facilitator_ledger.yaml` is a frozen artifact: its `ledger_freeze_hash` and
`ledger_authors.second_labeler: owner (pending)` reflect its state **at freeze
time**, and the committed scores / case_reports bind those exact hashes. Editing
the ledgers to flip `second_labeler` would change every freeze hash and strand
the committed score references. Ratification is therefore recorded **externally**
here, referencing each ledger by its frozen hash. The ledgers retain
`owner (pending)` as their accurate frozen-time state; **this record is the
durable, authoritative owner sign-off** that supersedes that caveat.

## What this does NOT change

- No `frozen_band_inputs`, derived band, blind judgement, or score changes.
- The pinned scoring key (`band_scorer.py` / `mapping_table.py`) is unchanged
  (`input_hashes` above match the Batch 1/2 pin). Ratifying bands is **not** a
  key change and does not stop or roll the batch.
- No new claim tier. Results remain **product-learning** signal — not validation,
  readiness, or buyer-proof. Ratification means the owner accepts the answer key,
  not that any result is validated.

## Non-claims

Not validation, not readiness, not buyer-proof, not a claim-tier advance. The
external arms (GPT-5.5 / Grok 4 / Gemini) are owner-run and not yet recorded.
JSG-08 caveats in the per-case findings (notably the saie recognition/outcome
alignment) stand independent of band ratification.
