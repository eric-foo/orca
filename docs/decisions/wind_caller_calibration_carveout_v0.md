## Status

`OWNER_SIGNED_DIRECTION_LOCK` — signed by owner 2026-06-13.

This record is a bounded carve-out to one prior boundary, scoped exclusively to
internal wind-caller calibration for creator/influencer wind-callers. It is not
validation, readiness, buyer proof, or commercial authorization.

## Amendment — 2026-06-14 (owner): attended-automated, human-mimicking pace

Tier-1's pace constraint is amended (dated; original preserved here, not silently
rewritten).

- **Original (2026-06-13):** "Human pace: human-scrolling rate only — no automated
  crawling, no scheduled scraping, no mass extraction."
- **Amended (2026-06-14, owner):** attended **automated** capture is permitted, but
  paced to imitate a human — a variable, irregular, human-speed scroll/fetch cadence
  (an ADHD-like rhythm), explicitly **not** uniform machine-rate, high-throughput
  blasting, or continuous/24-7 operation.

Unchanged: the anti-mass-extraction, no-standing/scheduled-crawler, attended,
≤5-account, pre-commercial, internal-only, US-first, and buy-at-commercial
constraints. Only the manual-vs-automated method is relaxed, and only to a
human-mimicking cadence. "Human pace" elsewhere in this record now reads as this
human-mimicking automated cadence.

## Amendment — 2026-06-14 (owner): scope of the ≤5-account / attended-capture cap

Owner-adjudicated in the demand-read-taxonomy lane (Q3; dated, original preserved).
The Tier-1 small-scale **capture** constraints — **≤5 accounts, attended
human-mimicking pace, IG-first sequencing, Social Blade discipline** — are scoped
to **social-platform creator capture (Instagram / TikTok / equivalent)**, the
ToS-risky scraping context they were written for. **Named public-figure
wind-caller calibration from other public outputs** (public web, detector venues,
public statements — not platform scraping) **is allowed more broadly**, subject to
**non-permanence**: records are time-bounded (retention/purge horizon per this
record), never permanent person dossiers. The "≤5 accounts" wording elsewhere in
this record now reads as this platform-capture-scoped cap.

Unchanged: internal judgment/calibration **use** only; and the **external/product
boundary** — Orca never sells or externally publishes a person-level surface
(Tier 3, permanent). This amendment relaxes only the *capture* cap for
non-platform named-public-figure calibration; it does **not** loosen the
external/product boundary. Selling or publishing any person-level surface remains
a separate charter-level decision, not granted here. Propagated surface: the
demand-read taxonomy's wind-caller boundary (Layer 2 / calibration read-type /
non-claims), updated the same day.

## Amendment — 2026-06-14 (owner): retention horizon set to 10 years, with takedown-on-request

The signed posture leaves the specific retention/purge horizon for the owner to set before
the first session. The owner sets it (dated):

- **Horizon: 10 years from capture, then purge** — longer than the proof-phase-duration
  default, to support a durable call-vs-outcome calibration time-series. (Rationale: most
  wind-callers won't persist near that long anyway, so 10 years is a generous-but-bounded
  ceiling, not indefinite accumulation.)
- **Standing commitment:** immediate takedown / purge on request — any subject, platform, or
  legal removal request is honored promptly.
- This **stays within** the signed "time-bounded, not permanent" posture (10 years is
  bounded); it simply fills in the owner-set horizon, longer than the default. **Not a
  reversal.** (Consistent with the ≤5-account-scope amendment above, which requires
  non-permanence — this sets the bounded horizon that amendment refers to.)

**Unchanged:** every other Tier-1 constraint (≤5 accounts at any one time, attended +
human-mimicking cadence, no standing/scheduled crawler, no mass extraction, pre-commercial,
internal-only, US-first, buy-at-commercial) and all Tier-3 exclusions.

## Amendment — 2026-06-15 (owner): the cap counts OUR operating accounts (not subjects), ≤10; active/passive method

Owner-adjudicated 2026-06-15 (creator-momentum lane). This **supersedes the count and the
referent** of the small-scale cap in the prior records above — which read "≤5 accounts" and, in
context, as ≤5 subject creators. Those prior dated lines are preserved as history; this amendment
governs going forward.

- **What the cap counts:** a ceiling on **Orca's own operating/capture accounts** (the
  accounts/sessions WE use to capture), **NOT** the number of subject creators. **Ceiling: ≤10**
  (operations start at ≤5; ≤10 is written now to avoid a future re-propagation).
- **Subject-creator roster: uncapped.** The calibration roster target is **all creators within the
  vertical** (e.g. all of a beauty sub-niche); the "small scale" framing no longer applies to the
  subject side.
- **Method — active / passive:**
  - **Active** (discovery + capture-target decisions) stays **attended** (human-initiated/supervised).
  - **Passive** (time-series monitoring of **already-flagged** creators) may run **human-initiated,
    time-bounded, and self-terminating** — it runs, captures over a defined period, then turns off;
    **no discovery during it.** This is **not** a perpetual/scheduled standing crawler, which remains
    forbidden.
  - Pace: **faster than human, but not takedown-risking.**
- **ToS risk:** owner-accepted at this scope.
- **Deliberately relaxed:** the small-scale subject cap (now all-in-vertical) and the strict
  "attended"/"human-mimicking pace" requirement for the bounded passive-monitoring phase.
- **UNCHANGED:** the external/product person-level boundary (Orca never sells/publishes a
  person-level surface); non-permanence + 10-year retention + takedown-on-request; commercial scale →
  licensed/bought data.

This is a doctrine change; its downstream surfaces are propagated under the
`direction_change_propagation` receipt at the foot of this record (creator-momentum
cap-redefinition, 2026-06-15).

## The Prior Boundary (baseline)

All Orca product and capture doctrine to date has held:

> "Wind callers are channels, not persons — tracked only through their public
> output and call record; person-level dossiers remain forbidden."

This carve-out amends that boundary in one bounded direction only. Every other
person-level exclusion is unchanged (see Tier 3 — Permanent Exclusions below).

## Tier 1 — Allowed Now (this carve-out)

For **internal wind-caller calibration only**, Orca may:

1. Identify an individual **public-figure** creator/influencer wind-caller by their
   **public handle and public name** as the calibration subject.
2. Record their **public outputs** — the "calls": posts, reviews, endorsements,
   trend participations — as dated calibration entries.
3. Record **public stats**: follower count, engagement rate, rank time-series,
   paid-promotion / sponsorship disclosure flags, trend-participation records.
4. Record **Orca's internal call-vs-outcome calibration**: how each wind-caller's
   public calls compared against observed market outcomes over time.

**Posture and constraints (non-negotiable within Tier 1):**

- Pre-commercial recon / bootstrap only.
- Small scale: **no more than 5 accounts** under this carve-out at any one time. *(Amended
  2026-06-15 — see amendment above: "accounts" = Orca's own operating/capture accounts, ceiling ≤10 /
  start ≤5; the subject-creator roster is uncapped / all-in-vertical; active=attended,
  passive=bounded self-terminating monitoring.)*
- Human-mimicking pace (amended 2026-06-14, see above): attended **automated**
  capture is permitted, but it must imitate human behaviour — a variable,
  irregular, human-speed scroll/fetch cadence (an ADHD-like rhythm), explicitly
  **not** a uniform machine rate, high-throughput blast, or continuous/24-7
  operation. No standing or scheduled crawler; no mass extraction.
- ToS risk: accepted by the owner at this scale, consistent with the project's
  measured-ToS-risk posture. At commercial scale, this becomes non-negotiable:
  licensed or bought data only.
- Platform sequencing: **Instagram (IG) first**; TikTok and other platforms later,
  under the same discipline.
- **Social Blade** may be read under the same discipline (free tier, human pace,
  pre-commercial). Social Blade data is second-hand (aggregated from platform
  feeds); it is suitable for stats (follower/rank time-series) but verbatim
  first-party call text must come from the public profile directly, not Social
  Blade. At commercial scale, Social Blade data also migrates to a licensed
  arrangement — non-negotiable.

**Use boundary:** internal judgment and calibration **only**. The compounding
asset is the calibration ledger ("who actually calls beauty winds, with receipts"),
not a public or sold data product. See Tier 3 for the permanent external exclusion.

**Retention posture: [Horizon SET 2026-06-14 — see "Amendment — 2026-06-14 (owner):
retention horizon set to 10 years, with takedown-on-request" above. The time-bounded
posture below STANDS; the amendment fills in the owner-set horizon (10 years) and adds
takedown-on-request.]** calibration records are
**time-bounded**, not permanent. The
owner will set a specific retention/purge horizon before the first calibration
session begins; records past their retention date are purged, not accumulated
indefinitely. Default posture: retain for the active proof-phase duration; review
for purge on any commercial-scale trigger or annual review, whichever comes first.

**Geography:** US-first creators (relying on CCPA publicly-available-information
exemption for public figures). Any EU or UK creator must be flagged and assessed for
a legitimate-interest basis and retention compliance **before** inclusion in the
calibration set.

## Tier 2 — Allowed-But-Deferred (sanctioned future capability, gated)

These capabilities are **not collected or activated now**. They are reclassified
from out-of-scope → **sanctioned-but-deferred**: each requires its own dated
authorization and a legal-gate check before any activation.

**A. Audience / follower-graph analytics.**
Network analysis of follower, commenter, or connection graphs for a wind-caller's
audience. The idea is analytically useful. It is deferred because it touches
ordinary followers who are not public figures — a **hard legal gate** applies
(GDPR/PIPEDA-style regimes; CCPA ordinary-consumer provisions; not covered by the
public-figure carve-out). Pre-conditions: separate dated authorization + legal
review + lawful-basis/consent model + data-minimization design.
Home: `docs/product/data_capture_spine/data_capture_spine_future_exploration_lanes_v0.md`
(reclassified from out-of-scope → sanctioned-but-deferred; see propagation below).

**B. Cross-platform public-handle stitching.**
Linking the same wind-caller's public handles across IG, TikTok, YouTube, etc. into
a unified calibration record. Pre-conditions: separate dated authorization + legal
review for any non-public-handle joins.
Home: `docs/product/data_capture_spine/data_capture_spine_future_exploration_lanes_v0.md`
(reclassified from out-of-scope → sanctioned-but-deferred; see propagation below).

Neither Tier 2 item is activated by this record. Each needs its own gate. Do not
treat reclassification as authorization.

## Tier 3 — Permanent Exclusions (unchanged; no carve-out)

These exclusions are **absolute** and are not touched by any tier of this record:

- Contact information, outreach, or lead lists derived from wind-callers.
- Special-category data (health, biometrics, political views, etc.).
- Genuinely private or non-public data (behind auth gates, DMs, private accounts).
- Resale, data-broker activity, or any sold person-level data product.
- Selling or externally publishing a person-level surface of any kind (unchanged;
  this carve-out is internal-only).

**LinkedIn / org-motion boundary:** the LinkedIn org-level person boundary is a
**separate context** and is **completely unchanged** by this record.
LinkedIn routes stay org-level only (hiring composition, headcount — never
person-level dossiers). Do not read this carve-out as touching LinkedIn doctrine.

## What This Record Is Not

- Not validation, readiness, or buyer-proof.
- Not authorization for commercial-scale wind-caller data collection.
- Not Tier-2 activation (neither audience-graph nor cross-platform stitching).
- Not outreach or contact acquisition.
- Not a change to the external/product boundary (Orca never sells or externally
  publishes a person-level surface; claim-defense doctrine governs any external
  sentence).
- Not a change to LinkedIn org-motion doctrine.

  doctrine_changed: >
    Orca now has a bounded owner-signed carve-out permitting internal
    creator/influencer wind-caller calibration (public handle + public name +
    public calls + public stats + call-vs-outcome calibration) at small scale
    (≤5 accounts), human pace, pre-commercial only; commercial scale triggers
    licensed/bought-data posture (non-negotiable). The "wind callers = channels
    not persons" boundary is amended only to this extent; all other person-level
    exclusions and the external/product boundary are unchanged. Two previously
    out-of-scope capabilities (audience/follower-graph analytics and
    cross-platform public-handle stitching) are reclassified to
    sanctioned-but-deferred with their own legal gates.
