## Status

Accepted 2026-06-09 (owner sign-off, eric-foo); amended 2026-06-09 to record the enforcement outcome.

- **Live:** CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the orca-harness suite on every `pull_request` and
  on `push` to `main`; verified green on both triggers (see Enforcement status).
- **Blocked:** the server-side hard merge gate (branch protection / rulesets) and `allow_auto_merge`
  are **not available** on this repository — it is private on a free plan, and GitHub returns HTTP
  403 ("Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public") for both classic branch protection
  and rulesets. They are **not applied**.
- **Interim (owner-selected):** keep CI plus a *merge-when-green* discipline (Decision item 7). The
  hard gate (items 2 and 4) is the deferred target end-state, unblocked only by a GitHub Pro/Team
  upgrade or making the repo public.

This record does not assert that any server-side gate is active. It is not.

## Context

- `main` had no CI: nothing validated commits automatically, so a green check could not gate merges.
- PR #1 reconciled a 28-commit, multi-workstream branch (`ecr-sp3-timing-deriver-slice1`) in one
  batch and was **closed unmerged** — too large and conflicting to land safely as one unit.
- Adopted pattern instead: small, focused, **per-lane PRs off `main`**, each merged when green.
- Lanes run concurrently via branches plus git worktrees, with a goal of eventually-unattended
  (overnight) merging.

## Decision

1. **CI.** A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the orca-harness test suite
   on every `pull_request` and on `push` to `main`: Ubuntu, Python 3.12, `pip install -e .`
   (orca-harness core dependencies only) plus a pinned `pytest`, then `python -m pytest` from
   `orca-harness/`. Single target — no version matrix, no path-filter, no dependency caching.
2. **Branch protection on `main`** (TARGET — deferred; blocked on this private+free repo, see
   Status). When enabled it requires:
   - the `orca-harness-tests` status check to pass;
   - a pull request before merging (`required_approving_review_count: 0` — a solo lane self-merges
     once CI is green);
   - `strict: false` (a branch need not be up-to-date with `main` before merging);
   - `enforce_admins: false` (the owner retains an emergency override).
3. **Per-lane PR flow.** Each lane branches off `main`, works in its own branch/worktree, and opens
   one focused PR. No multi-workstream mega-batches (the PR #1 lesson).
4. **Auto-merge** (TARGET — deferred; blocked on this private+free repo). When available, repo
   `allow_auto_merge` lets a lane set a PR to land the moment CI is green (unattended/overnight).
   `delete_branch_on_merge` **is** enabled now (it is not plan-gated); merged head branches are
   auto-deleted.
5. **Merge method.** Lane PRs squash-merge by default — one tidy commit per lane on `main`. Other
   methods remain available; squash is the documented default.
6. **Rebase cadence.** Each lane keeps its branch reasonably current with `main` (rebase or merge
   `main`) to limit semantic drift before merging. When the hard gate is enabled it will use
   `strict: false`, so this stays a lane responsibility rather than a server requirement.
7. **Interim enforcement (merge-when-green discipline).** Until a server-side gate is available, a
   lane must confirm the `orca-harness-tests` check is green (for example, `gh pr checks <n>`)
   before merging its PR, and must not merge a red or pending PR. This is a process commitment, not
   a server-enforced gate — nothing technically blocks a non-conforming merge — so it holds only as
   long as every lane follows it. An optional helper,
   `.github/scripts/merge-when-green.ps1`, performs this check-then-merge (it refuses unless the
   required check is green); using it is encouraged but not required, and it does not change this
   discipline.

## Why core-only CI (evidence)

main's full suite is green with **no optional extras installed** — a fresh virtualenv holding only
`pydantic` + `PyYAML` + `pytest` (no `playwright`, no `cloakbrowser`):

```
243 passed, 1 skipped in 29.44s   (exit 0)
```

The browser and `cloakbrowser` capture paths are decoupled by design: `*_no_runtime_imports`
contract tests assert the adapters import with no `playwright`/`cloakbrowser`/`requests`/etc., and
the snapshot tests drive fake engines rather than the real backends. So CI needs no extras, and a
path-filter is deliberately avoided (a filtered required check can strand docs-only PRs in a
permanent "pending" state and block merges). `pytest` is pinned (`==9.0.3`, the version verified in
the probe) so an upstream pytest release cannot silently break CI overnight. This evidence is
re-derivable and is re-run by CI on every PR; it is not a self-asserted pass.

## Explicitly not chosen

- **Version matrix** — single supported target (Python 3.12); revisit if Orca supports more runtimes.
- **Path-filter** — would risk a stuck required check on docs-only PRs.
- **Dependency caching** — install plus a ~30s suite is fast enough; add only if runs slow.
- **Extras in CI** — the suite is green without them; if a future lane legitimately needs an extra to
  test something, that is a separate, explicit CI extension (for example, an added job), not a
  silent change to this contract.

## Enforcement status (2026-06-09)

1. **CI — done & verified.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` merged to `main` (PR #3, squash `2611995`).
   Verified green on both triggers: `pull_request` (run 27150529791) and `push` to `main`
   (run 27151263680); core-only suite 243 passed / 1 skipped.
2. **Hard gate — attempted, blocked.** Classic branch protection
   (`PUT .../branches/main/protection`) and a repository ruleset (`POST .../rulesets`) both returned
   HTTP 403 (private repo on a free plan). `allow_auto_merge` could not be enabled (stayed `false`).
   `delete_branch_on_merge` was enabled. The exact commands are preserved with the lane for re-run
   after an upgrade or visibility change.
3. **Interim adopted.** Owner selected CI + merge-when-green discipline (Decision item 7); the hard
   gate stays the deferred target.

## Non-claims

- CI green is a test-suite signal only — **not** product, runtime, ECR/Cleaning/Judgment, or
  judgment-quality readiness, and not deployment.
- This doctrine does **not** grant any lane blanket commit/push/PR authority; the per-turn or
  accepted-handoff authorization requirement in `.agents/workflow-overlay/safety-rules.md` still
  applies.
- The interim merge-when-green discipline is a process commitment, **not** a server-enforced gate;
  its presence does not prove it is followed or that any merge actually passed CI.
- Not validation, readiness, or acceptance of any lane's content beyond "the test suite passed."

```yaml
direction_change_propagation:
  doctrine_changed: >
    Orca now has a developer-workflow doctrine: CI runs the orca-harness test suite on every PR and
    push to main (live), behind a per-lane PR off main with a squash default and a rebase cadence.
    The server-side hard merge gate (branch protection / rulesets) and auto-merge are the deferred
    target — blocked on this private+free repo (HTTP 403) — so interim enforcement is a
    merge-when-green discipline until a GitHub Pro/Team upgrade or public visibility unblocks the gate.

        Its rule "do not commit, push, configure remotes, or create pull requests unless explicitly
        authorized" is unchanged. This doctrine defines the merge gate and flow for when a lane is
        authorized; it does not grant standing commit/push/PR authority.
    - path: AGENTS.md
      reason: >
        The behavior kernel and authorization boundaries are unchanged; this is a decision record,
        not a kernel rule, and AGENTS.md already routes durable doctrine into docs/decisions and the
        overlay.
    - path: docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md
      reason: >
        The repo map is clean on main but carries uncommitted edits in the concurrent ecr lane;
        adding a pointer now would create a cross-lane merge conflict. The record lives in the
        canonical docs/decisions/ folder and is discoverable there. A one-line pointer can be added
        in a later turn once the repo-map lane settles.

        Source hierarchy and the propagation contract are unchanged; this record is a downstream
        decision, not an overlay-authority or hierarchy change. The same cross-lane-dirty caution as
        the repo map applies to its Known Source Documents list.

    a "status check" cell in a fixture-receipt review table and a "status checks" mention meaning
    `git status` in orca_bootstrap_record.md. This confirms the record is additive and forks no
    existing rule. The 2026-06-09 amendment corrects only this record's own enforcement statements
    and adds no doctrine vocabulary that conflicts with another surface.
