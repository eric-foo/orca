## Status

Accepted 2026-06-09 (owner sign-off, eric-foo); amended 2026-06-09 to record the enforcement outcome.

- **Live:** CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the orca-harness suite on every `pull_request` and
  on `push` to `main`; verified green on both triggers (see Enforcement status).
- **Blocked:** the server-side hard merge gate (branch protection / rulesets) and `allow_auto_merge`
  are **not available** on this repository — it is private on a free plan, and GitHub returns HTTP
  403 ("Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public") for both classic branch protection
  and rulesets. They are **not applied**.
- **Interim (owner-selected):** keep CI plus a *merge-when-green* flow under **structure B′**
  (Decision item 7): agents prep green PRs, and may **self-merge their own PR only when the
  protected-action guard confirms it is `mergeStateStatus == CLEAN` + all CI checks green + carries
  the opt-in `agent-automerge` label**; every other state (non-CLEAN, pending/failing checks, no
  label, missing/ambiguous PR number, the `gh api .../merge` form, foreign repo, or any lookup
  error/timeout) **fails closed to a human merge**, and the guard prints the repo-scoped manual
  command to run. This is enforced by the enforcement lane's protected-action guard, not discipline
  alone (the guard + its PreToolUse registration are durable on `main`; the guard's prior
  block-all-merges form landed via PR #15 — this amendment relaxes it to the CLEAN-gated form, owner-ratified 2026-06-12). The server-side hard gate (items 2 and 4) is the
  deferred target end-state, unblocked only by a GitHub Pro/Team upgrade or making the repo public —
  and remains the only **harness-agnostic** gate (this guard is Claude-Code-scoped).
- **Unattended auto-merge (added 2026-06-14, this lane):** a CI-controlled GitHub Actions workflow
  (`.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`) now lands a labeled (`agent-automerge`), clean, green, and
  **up-to-date** lane PR with **no agent session** — the unattended extension of structure B′ (Decision
  item 9). It uses an immediate `gh pr merge --squash` that does **not** need the 403-blocked
  `allow_auto_merge`, so it is still **not** the server-side gate. Code-backed and now **proven**
  (2026-06-15): the bot landed PR #121 unattended (merged by `github-actions[bot]`) after the
  `actions: read` permission fix (PR #118); an ineligible PR is still skipped, never mis-merged.
- **Opt-in unattended low-risk merge (workflow-backed):** `auto-merge.yml` may land a PR only when
  the PR carries both `agent-automerge` and the deterministic router label
  `risk/auto-merge-eligible`, has green CI, is mergeable, is up to date with `main`, is same-repo,
  and is not draft. The router (`pr-risk-router.yml`) defaults to
  `risk/manual-review-required` or `risk/blocked-for-merge-policy` for governance, CI, hook,
  overlay, decision, prompt, review, product, harness, large, deleting, fork, draft, or non-main
  PRs. This is not server-side branch protection and not a review/approval claim.

This record does not assert that any server-side gate is active. It is not.

## Context

- `main` had no CI: nothing validated commits automatically, so a green check could not gate merges.
- PR #1 reconciled a 28-commit, multi-workstream branch (`ecr-sp3-timing-deriver-slice1`) in one
  batch and was **closed unmerged** — too large and conflicting to land safely as one unit.
- Adopted pattern instead: small, focused, **per-lane PRs off `main`**, each merged when green.
- Lanes run concurrently via branches plus git worktrees, with a goal of eventually-unattended
  (overnight) merging.

## Decision

1. **CI.** A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the orca-harness test suite
   on every `pull_request` and on `push` to `main`: Ubuntu, Python 3.12, `pip install -e .`
   (orca-harness core dependencies only) plus a pinned `pytest`, then `python -m pytest` from
   `orca-harness/`. Single target — no version matrix, no path-filter, no dependency caching.
2. **Branch protection on `main`** (TARGET — deferred; blocked on this private+free repo, see
   Status). When enabled it requires:
   - the `orca-harness-tests` status check to pass;
   - a pull request before merging (`required_approving_review_count: 0`; under this *server-gated
     target* a solo lane could self-merge once green — the current interim (structure B′, item 7)
     approximates this locally: the guard allows an agent self-merge only on a CLEAN + CI-green +
     `agent-automerge`-labeled PR, and a human lands every other case);
   - `strict: false` (a branch need not be up-to-date with `main` before merging);
   - `enforce_admins: false` (the owner retains an emergency override).
3. **Per-lane PR flow.** Each lane branches off `main`, works in its own branch/worktree, and opens
   one focused PR. No multi-workstream mega-batches (the PR #1 lesson).
   **Codex/sandboxed lane-start writeability (harness-scoped, not a Claude Code rule).** For Codex or
   any sandboxed harness whose writes are mediated by workspace writable roots, the lane is not ready
   for repo-changing edits until the active worktree is the harness workspace root (or otherwise
   owner-configured as a writable root) and a lane-start write + git-index preflight passes in that
   worktree. The preflight writes a throwaway file, stages it, unstages it, deletes it, and reads
   `git status --short`; failure to create, stage, unstage, or cleanly remove the probe is a stop
   condition: reroot/reopen the harness on the active worktree, or create a new owner-configured
   writable worktree and retry. Escalated writes are a bounded fallback for the current operation only,
   not the normal lane path. This is Codex/sandboxed-harness scoped; it does **not** add a mandatory
   lane-start probe to Claude Code lanes whose harness already writes to their active worktree and
   reports write failures directly. Avoid relying on nested or secondary writable roots for Codex on
   Windows unless this preflight passes.

   **Codex/manual patch discipline.** For Codex `apply_patch`, generated diffs, or manual textual
   replacement flows, a corrupt patch, failed hunk, or expected-text mismatch is a stop-and-reread
   condition: read the live target lines, then patch from observed current text before continuing. Before
   claiming the edit is correct, inspect the changed hunks with `git diff`; `git diff --check` is only
   whitespace/conflict-marker lint and must not be reported as content-correctness evidence. This clause
   mainly binds Codex/manual patching; it does not add a new mandatory step to Claude Code edit flows
   whose tool already requires live file reads, though any missed edit still routes to stop-and-reread.

4. **Auto-merge** (TARGET — deferred; blocked on this private+free repo). When available, repo
   `allow_auto_merge` lets a lane set a PR to land the moment CI is green (unattended/overnight).
   `delete_branch_on_merge` **is** enabled now (it is not plan-gated); merged head branches are
   auto-deleted. (Update 2026-06-14: an **interim** unattended auto-merge that does **not** need the
   403-blocked `allow_auto_merge` is now live via a CI-controlled Actions workflow — see Decision item
   9; the native `allow_auto_merge` + merge-queue path remains the deferred gold-standard target.)
5. **Merge method.** Lane PRs squash-merge by default — one tidy commit per lane on `main`. Other
   methods remain available; squash is the documented default.
6. **Rebase cadence.** Each lane keeps its branch reasonably current with `main` (rebase or merge
   `main`) to limit semantic drift before merging. When the hard gate is enabled it will use
   `strict: false`, so this stays a lane responsibility rather than a server requirement.
7. **Interim enforcement — structure B′ (guard-verified CLEAN self-merge; else human-landed).** Until
   a server-side gate is available, agents **prepare** green PRs — push their own lane branch, open the
   PR, confirm the `orca-harness-tests` check is green. An agent **may self-merge its own PR** with a
   direct `gh pr merge <N>`, but **only when the protected-action guard
   (`.agents/hooks/guard_protected_actions.py`) confirms the PR is `mergeStateStatus == CLEAN`, every
   CI check has completed green, and it carries the opt-in `agent-automerge` label.** Every other case
   — a non-CLEAN state (`UNSTABLE` / `BLOCKED` / `BEHIND` / `DIRTY` / `DRAFT` / `UNKNOWN` / …), pending
   or failing checks, an empty check set, a missing/ambiguous PR number, the no-arg form, the
   lower-level `gh api .../merge` form, a foreign `--repo`, or any lookup error/timeout — **fails
   closed**: the guard blocks (exit 2) and prints the repo-scoped manual command
   (`gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch --repo eric-foo/orca`) for a human to run from anywhere.
   Push to `main`, force-push, and destructive `reset --hard` / `clean` stay hard-blocked; a benign
   lane-branch push stays allowed. **Why CLEAN + green + label, not bare CLEAN:** on this repo branch
   protection is 403-blocked, so no check is *required* and an empty/early check set can read `CLEAN`
   before CI even starts — requiring the rollup present-and-green (plus an explicit opt-in label)
   closes that false-green race and makes self-merge a deliberate, auditable act. The **opt-in label
   is the agent's deliberate marker**; one-time setup `gh label create agent-automerge --repo
   eric-foo/orca` makes it applyable, and absent the label nothing auto-merges. **Liveness (durable on
   `main`):** the guard and its `.claude/settings.json` PreToolUse registration are **durable on
   `main`** — they landed via PR #15 (then in block-all-merges form) and are verified tracked +
   registered on `origin/main`; this amendment relaxes the guard to the CLEAN-gated form, and **a human
   lands this amendment's own PR**, because the pre-amendment guard blocks all `gh pr merge`. The
   git-lifecycle protection (EP-03) is portable and durable on every clone; external-path protection
   (EP-01) stays per-machine. **Harness scope:** the guard is a `.claude/settings.json` `PreToolUse`
   hook matching Claude Code tools, so this protection — and the CLEAN self-merge allowance — holds for
   **Claude Code sessions only**. A non-Claude-Code harness (e.g. Codex) is **not** guard-gated until
   the same script is wired into its own config; the only **harness-agnostic, unbypassable** gate
   remains the deferred server-side branch protection (items 2 and 4). **This supersedes the earlier
   structure-B "agents do not self-merge; a human lands every merge" wording** (and the still-earlier
   target "a solo lane self-merges once CI is green"): self-merge is now allowed but **narrowly,
   guard-verified, and fail-closed**. The helper `.github/scripts/merge-when-green.ps1` remains the
   **human's** check-then-merge tool; agents must **not** use it to self-merge — it wraps `gh pr merge`
   inside a script subprocess the PreToolUse guard does **not** see (hooks fire on the agent's direct
   tool call, not on grandchild processes), so running it would **bypass the CLEAN/label
   verification**. Agents self-merge only via a direct `gh pr merge <N>`, which the guard inspects.

   **GitHub API sandbox-egress classification.** A `gh` / GitHub API failure that names
   `127.0.0.1:9`, or connection-refused to a local proxy/discard port, is sandbox egress refusal,
   not evidence that the repository, PR, branch, or CI state failed. Prefer an available GitHub
   connector for the read/write path; if using `gh`, network escalation is a bounded owner-gated
   fallback for that operation only. Without a connector result or escalated readback, remote state is
   unverified and must not be reported as failed, green, pushed, created, or merged.

8. **Lane-isolation integrity — early detection, not a hard gate.** Lane isolation (the AGENTS.md
   rule, PR #9) is a *judgment* rule, so its integrity mechanism is **early detection**, not another
   hard block. A read-only detector, `.github/scripts/lane-health-check.ps1` (PR #11), surfaces drift
   before it compounds: (a) uncommitted pile-up on a shared base, (b) worktree sprawl, and (c)
   machine-local enforcement — any `.agents/hooks/*.py` present in the working tree but not tracked on
   `origin/main` (a hook that enforces only on this machine). A non-zero exit is a **nudge**
   (operator- or periodic-run), never an unattended block — early detection chosen over a hard
   SessionStart reminder, which was considered and not taken. The detector is read-only with respect
   to the working tree, index, and local branches; `-Fetch` is its only network action.
9. **Unattended auto-merge bot (extends structure B′).** `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` is the
   **unattended** extension of item 7: where structure B′ lets the **in-session** agent self-merge a
   CLEAN + green + `agent-automerge`-labeled PR via the guard, this workflow lands the **same** opt-in
   PRs **with no agent session** — triggered on CI completion (`workflow_run` on `ci`), with a 3-hour
   `cron` backstop and `workflow_dispatch`. It runs in Actions (declaring its own `contents` /
   `pull-requests: write`, since the repo default is read-only) and is **not** subject to the PreToolUse
   guard, so it carries its **own** guardrails in code: the `agent-automerge` label, the
   deterministic router label `risk/auto-merge-eligible`, no `risk/manual-review-required` or
   `risk/blocked-for-merge-policy` label, `mergeable == MERGEABLE`, the `orca-harness-tests` check
   green (and no failing/pending check), **`behind_by == 0` (up-to-date with `main`)**, **one merge
   per run** (safe serialization — there is no native merge queue), and squash + delete-branch. The
   up-to-date guard is **stricter than** the in-session guard
   path (which checks CLEAN but not up-to-date); closing that gap in the guard itself is a deferred
   enforcement-lane follow-on. It uses an immediate `gh pr merge --squash`, which needs no
   `allow_auto_merge` (item 4), so it is **not** the server-side gate. **Honest limitation:** a bot
   merge via `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not re-trigger the `push:main` CI run (GitHub's no-recursion rule); the
   PR's own green check plus the up-to-date guard stand in. The EP-03 guard and `merge-when-green.ps1`
   are unchanged. **Liveness — proven 2026-06-15:** the bot's **first unattended merge is proven** — it
   landed PR #121 with no agent session (merged by `github-actions[bot]`), after PR #118 added the
   `actions: read` scope its `statusCheckRollup` eligibility query needs (without it every prior run
   failed GraphQL `Resource not accessible by integration`, so no earlier run had actually merged). An
   ineligible PR is still skipped, never mis-merged. The 2026-06-16 risk-router amendment narrows
   the bot further: `agent-automerge` alone is no longer sufficient for unattended merge.
10. **Lane-start auto-prune — the cleanup complement to item 9.** Item 9's bot closes the *merge* half
   of the agent-fast-creation / human-gated-cleanup velocity mismatch; this standing
   **agent-instruction-only** rule closes the *cleanup* half. At the **start of each new lane** (the
   cleanup rides on the next creation, so no new always-on infrastructure is added), the agent runs a
   bounded, **non-destructive** prune of **merged** residue:
   1. `git fetch --prune origin` — refresh remote-tracking refs and drop stale ones. This prunes only
      `refs/remotes/origin/*`; it never removes a worktree or a local branch.
   2. For every worktree whose branch reads `[gone]` (its squash-merged remote branch auto-deleted under
      item 4's `delete_branch_on_merge` + item 5's squash default) **and** that has **no open PR**:
      `git worktree remove "<path>"` — **non-force only**.
   3. `git branch -D` the `[gone]` branches — covering **both** worktree-bound and branch-only `[gone]`
      branches (the proven backlog sweep did both).
   - **Load-bearing safety guards (the rule is unsafe without them):**
     - **Non-force `git worktree remove` only — never `--force`.** Non-force `remove` *refuses* a worktree
       holding uncommitted/untracked content; that refusal is the safety that makes the rule unable to
       discard unsaved work. A refused worktree is left for the owner, never force-discarded.
     - **Exclude open-PR worktrees.** Re-derive `gh pr list --state open` and skip any worktree/branch
       with an open PR — removing it would disrupt in-flight review/work.
     - **Never prune the seal or any `[ahead]`-with-unpushed-commits worktree.** The seal worktree
       (`orca-seal-wt` / branch `pilot-seal-outcome`) holds the only copy of a firewalled,
       outcome-sensitive result — never prune it and never read its sealed file. Re-derive the live
       `[ahead]` set (`git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(upstream:track)' refs/heads | rg
       ahead`) and exclude every entry; an `[ahead]` branch has unpushed unique commits.
     - **Glance for closed-unmerged before `-D`.** A closed-unmerged (or manually-deleted-remote) PR's
       branch *also* reads `[gone]` while its work is **not** on `main`; before deleting, glance
       `gh pr list --state all --head <branch>` and keep any closed-unmerged branch.
     - **Re-derive live every time — never act on a cached list.** The repo moves fast (a single session
       has seen the worktree count and `origin/main` shift repeatedly), so re-derive `git worktree list`,
       the `[gone]`/`[ahead]` sets, and the open-PR set at each lane start.
   - **Boundaries (what this rule is *not*):** not a new always-on destructive automation; not a
     `--force` prune of dirty/open-PR worktrees; not a throttle on lane creation (the chosen lever
     automates the cleanup *tail*, it does not slow creation); not an edit to the EP-03 protected-action
     guard (item 7). Wiring the item-8 detector (`.github/scripts/lane-health-check.ps1`) to *perform or
     prompt* the prune is an explicit **optional follow-on**, deliberately deferred so this additive rule
     introduces no destructive script — the detector stays read-only.
   - **Why a lane-start agent rule (not a git hook):** PR merges are server-side, so a client
     `post-merge` hook never fires; the cleanup must ride on the next lane's creation. **Liveness:** this
     is a behavioral/doctrine rule, not code — it is "live" only insofar as agents follow it, and it
     asserts **no** proven long-run bound on worktree/branch count (that outcome is unproven until the
     rule runs across several lanes). Owner-gated; lands via a per-lane PR off `main` (squash).
11. **Standing self-label policy — when the lane author applies the opt-in marker.** Items 7 and 9 keep
   `agent-automerge` an **opt-in marker** and the bot/guard act only on labeled PRs — that mechanism is
   **unchanged**. This item adds the lane author's **standing policy for *when* to apply that marker**: a
   lane author applies `agent-automerge` to its **own** CLEAN + green PR **by default for routine,
   low-risk changes** it judges safe to land unattended, and **withholds** it — leaving the PR for owner
   review — for higher-risk changes. The marker stays a deliberate, per-PR judgment (it is **not**
   auto-applied by path or automation); this item only sets the default *direction* of that judgment, so
   routine work lands unattended while the human gate is preserved exactly where it matters. It shifts
   the routine-work default from "wait for the owner" to "land unattended," not the merge mechanism.
   - **Apply by default (safe to land unattended) when ALL hold:** it is the author's **own** lane work,
     scoped and traceable to the request; CLEAN + green; and a routine low-risk change — additive
     documentation, decisions/prompts/reviews/migration notes the author is confident in, or a small
     scoped code change with clear test coverage — that needs no human diff-review.
   - **Withhold (leave for owner review) when ANY hold:** it touches enforcement/safety surfaces (the
     EP-01/EP-03 guard, hooks, `.claude/settings.json`, CI or auto-merge workflows, this
     branch-protection doctrine), makes a contested doctrine/tradeoff decision, carries high downstream
     lock-in (schema, interface, persisted data shape), the author is uncertain, or the owner asked to
     review it. **When in doubt, withhold.**
   - **Authority unchanged:** this grants **no new merge authority** — item 7's guard (CLEAN + green +
     label, fail-closed) and the per-lane / accepted-handoff authorization required to open the PR at all
     are unchanged. The owner can always remove the label to hold a PR, and can still CLI-merge anything
     directly. Unlabeled, non-CLEAN, or non-green PRs still go to a human (item 7) — unchanged.
   - **Why author judgment, not a path Action:** "safe to land unattended" is a **content judgment**, not
     a mechanically-checkable path fact, so per the overlay's Enforcement Placement principle
     (`.agents/workflow-overlay/decision-routing.md`) it belongs in an actor-carried rule, not a
     deterministic substrate. A path-scoped auto-label Action (deterministic; would apply to every PR,
     including human- or other-harness-opened ones) remains an explicit **optional follow-on**,
     deliberately not taken here.
   - **Liveness / non-claims:** a behavioral/doctrine rule, not code — "live" only insofar as agents
     follow it; it does **not** assert that auto-landed PRs are correct (CI is a test-suite signal only;
     main is not deployed and a bad merge is reversible by a follow-up PR). Owner-gated; lands via a
     per-lane PR off `main` (squash).
12. **Up-to-date-before-merge — adopted MGT (bot-as-default + forward-ref annotation + red-main
   detector).** Recurring red `push:main` CI from **combination breaks** — two independently-green PRs
   that break when combined (e.g. one adds an `open_next` reference, another renames/removes the target).
   **Root cause:** the up-to-date (`behind_by == 0`) check is enforced for **only one of three** merge
   paths — the bot (item 9). The in-session guard (item 7) checks CLEAN+green+label but **not** up-to-date
   (documented residual), and a human / other-harness raw `gh pr merge` checks nothing. CI tests
   merge-with-base **at PR time**, so a PR merged while behind is never re-tested against current `main`.
   Rationale + full option analysis: the up-to-date-merge enforcement proposal (PR #129). This adopts the
   **mini-god-tier** target — most of the complete fix's value at a fraction of its cost, foregone limit
   named:
   - **Bot-as-default merge path.** Routine PRs land via the bot (apply `agent-automerge`; the bot
     enforces `behind_by == 0` + green + mergeable); raw `gh pr merge` is reserved for urgent fixes. This
     puts up-to-date enforcement on the default path **for free** (item 9's bot is proven) and extends
     item 11 (self-label) from agents to the default merge habit.
   - **Forward-ref annotation discipline (closes the class up-to-date cannot).** An `open_next` /
     `derived_from` link to a file **intentionally not yet on `main`** (a branch-only forward-reference)
     MUST carry a trailing `# nonresolving: <reason>` comment, which `.agents/hooks/check_map_links.py`
     exempts from the existence check and counts as annotated debt — so a deliberate forward-ref cannot
     hard-fail `push:main`. (Up-to-date enforcement, and even the server-side gate, cannot catch this
     class: the target never lands on `main`.)
   - **Red-main detector (detective backstop).** `.github/workflows/main-red-alert.yml` opens a single
     deduplicated tracking issue the moment a `push:main` CI run fails and auto-closes it when `main`
     goes green — so a break landed via an unenforced path is fixed in minutes, not discovered by the
     next lane. **Liveness:** code-backed, **not yet proven** on a live red `main` (the first real
     failure proves it). Detective, **not** preventive.
   - **Downgraded (not adopted now):** *O2a* — add `behind_by == 0` to the EP-03 in-session guard's
     self-merge allowance; covers only the rare agent in-session self-merge (agents route through the bot
     by default) at the cost of editing the frozen, enforcement-lane-owned guard. *O2b* — make
     `.github/scripts/merge-when-green.ps1` refuse when behind; a substrate that fires only if the helper
     is used, so a raw `gh pr merge` bypasses it. Revisit either if agents become the primary mergers.
   - **Deferred end-state:** server-side branch protection "require branches up to date" (+ merge queue)
     — the only **complete, harness-agnostic, unbypassable** prevention across all paths. Blocked on this
     private+free repo (HTTP 403, items 2/4); revisit on a GitHub Pro/Team upgrade or a public repo.
   - **Foregone limitation (consciously accepted):** a human or non-Claude-harness raw `gh pr merge` of a
     **behind** PR can still combination-break `main` — **detected fast** by the red-main detector, **not
     prevented**. Closing this residual requires the deferred server-side gate.
13. **PR cadence — major durable point, not every subpoint.** A lane should open a focused PR after
   each **major durable point**: one coherent, owner-reviewable decision or artifact boundary that
   future agents may rely on. Examples include a first customer / ICP target selection, proof-gate
   change, buyer-risk doctrine change, data-spine boundary change, roster-scope implication, or an
   implementation-scoping decision that closes its work unit (item 14: a scoping artifact produced
   mid-chain under pre-granted implementation authority rides with its chain, not as its own PR).
   Do **not** split every thought, objection, or supporting
   refinement into its own PR; group subpoints when they change the same durable point, share the same
   controlling sources, and should be reviewed with the same validation and non-claims. If a new major
   point emerges while a lane is already open, either include it only when it is directly coupled to
   the same reviewable decision or split it into a follow-up branch / PR. Each such PR should state:
   what decision changed, why it changed, what stance shifted or was magnified, changed files,
   explicit non-claims, and validation run. This cadence does not grant standing commit, push, or PR
   authority; `.agents/workflow-overlay/safety-rules.md` still requires explicit authorization.
14. **PR boundary — per work unit, fixed at commissioning (owner-directed 2026-07-02).** A lane PR
   is cut per **work unit**, not per pipeline stage. A planning/scoping-only artifact (a route,
   spec, or scoping decision) is not a standalone PR by default: it rides with the work unit that
   produced it, or the chain continues into implementation when authority allows. Where the PR
   boundary sits is decided **at commissioning time** by the commissioning artifact (the handoff
   packet or `/fused` invocation), recorded in the edit-permission grant every such artifact already
   states (the `read-only | docs-write | patch-only | implementation-authorized` preflight field
   owned by `.agents/workflow-overlay/prompt-orchestration.md`):
   - **Pre-granted bounded implementation authority** → the full scope→spec→implement→review chain
     is one work unit landing as **one lane PR**; the owner steers at commissioning time.
   - **Authority deliberately withheld** → the mid-chain owner authorization fork **is** the
     explicit work-unit boundary, and the chain lands as **split PRs**. Withholding is a deliberate
     commissioning choice, never the default drift.
   **Named exceptions — splitting stays correct even with pre-granted authority:** (a) the earlier
   half carries shared-authority doctrine that other concurrent lanes need on `main` promptly
   (example: PR #585 landed the Gate 1/2 contract fold-in together with a read-only scoping route
   while implementation stayed split behind a packet-mandated owner fork); (b) authority is
   deliberately withheld for a mid-chain owner fork (the second bullet above); (c) high-lock-in
   probe-first slicing per the Smallest Complete Intervention rule (`AGENTS.md`).
   **Boundaries:** this rule governs PR *topology*, not merge *authority* — items 7/9/11 and the
   human gate on landing to `main` are unchanged, and pre-granting implementation authority remains
   an owner choice recorded in the commissioning artifact, never an agent default. It is not a
   license for big-bang PRs: item 13's cadence and the Smallest Complete Intervention rule still
   govern work-unit size; this item only fixes where the PR boundary sits relative to the owner
   authorization fork.

## Why core-only CI (evidence)

main's full suite is green with **no optional extras installed** — a fresh virtualenv holding only
`pydantic` + `PyYAML` + `pytest` (no `playwright`, no `cloakbrowser`):

```
243 passed, 1 skipped in 29.44s   (exit 0)
```

The browser and `cloakbrowser` capture paths are decoupled by design: `*_no_runtime_imports`
contract tests assert the adapters import with no `playwright`/`cloakbrowser`/`requests`/etc., and
the snapshot tests drive fake engines rather than the real backends. So CI needs no extras, and a
path-filter is deliberately avoided (a filtered required check can strand docs-only PRs in a
permanent "pending" state and block merges). `pytest` is pinned (`==9.0.3`, the version verified in
the probe) so an upstream pytest release cannot silently break CI overnight. This evidence is
re-derivable and is re-run by CI on every PR; it is not a self-asserted pass.

## Explicitly not chosen

- **Version matrix** — single supported target (Python 3.12); revisit if Orca supports more runtimes.
- **Path-filter** — would risk a stuck required check on docs-only PRs.
- **Dependency caching** — install plus a ~30s suite is fast enough; add only if runs slow.
- **Extras in CI** — the suite is green without them; if a future lane legitimately needs an extra to
  test something, that is a separate, explicit CI extension (for example, an added job), not a
  silent change to this contract.

## Enforcement status (2026-06-09)

1. **CI — done & verified.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` merged to `main` (PR #3, squash `2611995`).
   Verified green on both triggers: `pull_request` (run 27150529791) and `push` to `main`
   (run 27151263680); core-only suite 243 passed / 1 skipped.
2. **Hard gate — attempted, blocked.** Classic branch protection
   (`PUT .../branches/main/protection`) and a repository ruleset (`POST .../rulesets`) both returned
   HTTP 403 (private repo on a free plan). `allow_auto_merge` could not be enabled (stayed `false`).
   `delete_branch_on_merge` was enabled. The exact commands are preserved with the lane for re-run
   after an upgrade or visibility change.
3. **Interim adopted.** Owner selected CI + merge-when-green discipline (Decision item 7); the hard
   gate stays the deferred target.

## Non-claims

- CI green is a test-suite signal only — **not** product, runtime, ECR/Cleaning/Judgment, or
  judgment-quality readiness, and not deployment.
- This doctrine does **not** grant any lane blanket commit/push/PR authority; the per-turn or
  accepted-handoff authorization requirement in `.agents/workflow-overlay/safety-rules.md` still
  applies.
- The interim merge-when-green discipline is a process commitment, **not** a server-enforced gate;
  its presence does not prove it is followed or that any merge actually passed CI.
- Risk-router labels and merge-packet comments are routing/check signal only — **not** validation,
  approval, review acceptance, readiness, or proof that a PR is safe to merge.
- Not validation, readiness, or acceptance of any lane's content beyond "the test suite passed."

direction_change_propagation:
  doctrine_changed: >
    Adds Decision item 14 (owner-directed 2026-07-02): a lane PR is cut per WORK UNIT, not per
    pipeline stage, and a planning/scoping-only artifact is not a standalone PR by default — it
    rides with the work unit that produced it, or the chain continues when authority allows. The
    commissioning artifact (handoff packet or /fused invocation) fixes the boundary at commissioning
    time via the edit-permission grant it already states: pre-granted bounded implementation
    authority means the full scope→spec→implement→review chain lands as one lane PR; deliberately
    withheld authority makes the mid-chain owner authorization fork the explicit work-unit boundary
    (split PRs — a deliberate choice, never the default drift). Named exceptions where splitting
    stays correct even with pre-granted authority: (a) the earlier half carries shared-authority
    doctrine other concurrent lanes need on main promptly (example: PR #585), (b) authority withheld
    for a mid-chain owner fork, (c) high-lock-in probe-first slicing per Smallest Complete
    Intervention. Item 13's example list is reconciled in place: an implementation-scoping decision
    is a PR-worthy durable point only when it closes its work unit.
