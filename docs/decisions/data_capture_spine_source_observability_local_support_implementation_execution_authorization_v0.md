# Data Capture Spine Source-Observability Local Support Implementation Execution Authorization v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Product artifact
scope: Owner authorization and durable trace for the bounded local source-observability support implementation execution after implementation scoping.
use_when:
  - Checking whether the local source-observability helper implementation had execution authority beyond implementation scoping.
  - Confirming the implemented helper boundary: local operator posture records, checker, report runner, docs, and tests only.
  - Confirming that source-access implementation, live capture, archive retrieval, media preservation, browser automation, contract hardening, ECR, Cleaning, and Judgment work remain out of scope.

  - The local source-observability helper materially expands beyond operator-authored posture records, checker/report output, docs, and tests.
  - The source-observability requirements scoping artifact or implementation-scoping authorization is materially revised.
  - The source-access boundary, source-access method plan, Data Capture obligation contract, Data Capture/Cleaning/Judgment boundary, commissioning plan, or execution authorization is materially amended in a way that changes local helper authority.

## Status And Decision

Status: `AUTHORIZED_SOURCE_OBSERVABILITY_LOCAL_SUPPORT_IMPLEMENTATION_EXECUTION_V0`.

Owner decision:
`RATIFY_BOUNDED_LOCAL_SOURCE_OBSERVABILITY_SUPPORT_IMPLEMENTATION_EXECUTION`.

This decision records durable owner authority for the bounded local
source-observability support implementation that followed the prior
implementation-scoping lane. The implementation is limited to local support that
helps operators record and inspect source-observability posture from already
captured artifacts.

This artifact closes the authority-trace gap that implementation scoping alone
does not authorize implementation execution. It does not authorize additional
implementation beyond the bounded local helper surfaces named here.

## Source Basis

Decision inputs:

- Current owner correction: "scoping shouldnt imply the authority to implement".
- Current owner instruction: "proceed".
- `docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_observability_local_support_implementation_scoping_authorization_v0.md`.
- `docs/product/data_capture_spine_source_observability_requirements_scoping_v0.md`.
- `docs/review-outputs/source_observability_helper_adversarial_implementation_review_v0.md`.
- `docs/review-outputs/source_observability_helper_blast_radius_recheck_v0.md`.
- `orca-harness/docs/source_observability_scalability_note.md`.

Implementation history recorded for traceability:

- `5463549 feat: add source observability helper`.
- `84fa6d9 feat: add source observability report runner`.
- `c57a669 docs: document source observability runner`.
- `d70e25f docs: add source observability record guide`.
- `fe94449 docs: add source observability operator template`.
- `27cae7b feat: include source observability record summaries`.
- `a7c3463 docs: add source observability scalability note`.
- `b9adaa2 chore: classify harness generated outputs`.

These commit references identify the bounded local surfaces already implemented
or documented. They are traceability evidence, not validation, readiness, source
adequacy, or product proof.

## Authorized Implemented Surface

The bounded implemented surface is local source-observability support for
operator-authored posture records and deterministic local reporting.

Authorized implementation surface:

- `orca-harness/source_observability/` local models and checker logic;
- `orca-harness/runners/run_source_observability_report.py` local report runner;
- `orca-harness/docs/source_observability_operator_records.md`;
- `orca-harness/docs/source_observability_operator_records_template.yaml`;
- `orca-harness/docs/source_observability_scalability_note.md`;
- source-observability unit and contract tests that enforce the local boundary;
- harness README guidance needed to describe the local helper boundary;
- `.gitignore` and harness config hygiene needed to keep generated dry-run
  outputs separate from source.

The helper may help an operator record posture for source language, visible
source structure, archive-body posture, media/layout posture, access posture,
locator visibility, cutoff visibility, and limitation notes.

The helper must keep human posture judgment visible. It must not represent its
output as extracted source truth, capture validation, capture readiness,
source-access success, or a required handoff gate.

## Deferred And Forbidden Scope

This decision does not authorize:

- future implementation expansion beyond the bounded local surfaces above;
- live capture;
- source acquisition;
- archive retrieval;
- screenshot capture or media preservation implementation;
- scraper, API, browser automation, crawler, proxy, anti-detect, package,
  deployment, storage, dashboard, or database design;
- source-access method-plan amendment;
- Data Capture obligation-contract amendment or hardening;
- source-access boundary change;
- final ECR field, key, ID, receipt, table, schema, storage, or file-format
  design;
- Cleaning implementation, normalization rules, clustering rules, dedupe rules,
  or transformation pipelines;
- Judgment rules, credibility rules, exclusion rules, discounting rules, Signal
  Use, Decision Strength, Action Ceiling, or synthesis logic;
- buyer proof, commercial-readiness claims, production-readiness claims, or
  validation/readiness claims.

If future work needs archive retrieval, media capture, browser automation,
source-access method changes, contract hardening, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, or
new source-family-specific structured fields, it requires a separate owner
authorization.

## Review And Recheck Status

The implementation was adversarially reviewed in
`docs/review-outputs/source_observability_helper_adversarial_implementation_review_v0.md`.
That review found the local boundary was respected and identified one major
checker correctness finding.

The patch was then rechecked in
`docs/review-outputs/source_observability_helper_blast_radius_recheck_v0.md`.
The recheck reported the major finding closed and the helper safe for continued
bounded use with an advisory double-reporting carry.

Those review reports are evidence for boundary and local correctness posture.
They are not validation, readiness, capture closure, source adequacy, or product
proof.

## Next Gate

The next source-observability decision should be evidence-led. The local helper
may be dry-used against additional pressure-test surfaces, such as Slot 2 Teal,
to learn whether the existing posture model is enough or whether a later
bounded helper refinement is warranted.

Do not promote new structured fields, limitation types, fixture policy, or
source-family-specific invariants from this decision alone. Use the extension
and promotion rule in `orca-harness/docs/source_observability_scalability_note.md`.

## Non-Claims

This decision is not validation, readiness, pressure-test discharge, source
adequacy, capture closure, source-of-truth promotion, source-access
implementation authorization, archive-retrieval authorization,
media-preservation authorization, browser-automation authorization, contract
hardening, obligation-contract amendment, source-access method-plan amendment,
runtime authorization, tooling authorization, schema authorization, ECR design,
Cleaning implementation, Judgment design, buyer proof, or commercial-readiness
evidence.
