# Orca Audience-Inference Ballot Taxonomy v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: owner-adjudicated design-adoption decision record
scope: >
  Adopts the Tier-1 "ballot" taxonomy for creator ideal-audience inference: the
  output-field (bucket) set, a canonical label vocabulary + alias map, and a positive
  4-way router that replaces the leaky demographic denylist. Records the SETTLED answer
  to the Tier-1/Tier-2-A collapse question and the sequencing for taking Tier-2-A
  demographics live. Design adoption only -- not validation, readiness, or product proof.
use_when:
  - Changing the audience-inference bucket set, label vocabulary, or the Tier-1 routing guard.
  - Deciding whether to collapse Tier-1 and Tier-2-A (answered here: no).
  - Sequencing the Tier-2-A (gender/age) demographics slice.

  - The fusion modality-cap / abstention model changes.

## Status

`OWNER_ADJUDICATED_DESIGN_LOCK` — adopted in-repo 2026-06-25 after an external
(ChatGPT-Pro, no-repo) reasoning pass on the prompt artifact named above, applied
under Smallest Complete Intervention + mini-god-tier. This is a design-adoption
record, not validation, readiness, calibration, or buyer proof. The owning authority
for the tier boundary remains `docs/decisions/wind_caller_calibration_carveout_v0.md`;
the owning spec remains the IG creator ideal-audience inference spec.

## Problem

The deciding (`scoring/audience_fusion.py`) tallies BY EXACT LABEL. With free-text
labels, synonyms split the vote (`beginner` / `newbie` / `starter` = three answers
that never combine), and the Tier-1/Tier-2-A boundary was guarded by a **denylist**
that leaks on novel phrasings. Both weaken the inference.

## Decision (adopted)

1. **Bucket set = the 5 existing Tier-1 fields** (`segment`, `audience_role`,
   `purchase_intent`, `skill_level`, `price_tier`). A 6th `aesthetic_vibe` field was
   considered (ChatGPT-proposed) but **deferred** — see Deferred. The canonical-label +
   router hardening below stands on its own and is the value of this change.
2. **Canonical label vocabulary + alias map** (`schemas/audience_label_ontology.py`).
   The deciding tallies only canonical labels; synonyms are aliased to a canonical key,
   never independent tally keys. Vertical-scoped (fragrance/beauty v0); other verticals
   extend by adding label sets — the engine (buckets, caps, abstention) is unchanged
   and platform-general.
3. **Positive 4-way router replaces the denylist** (`cleaning/audience_extractor.py`,
   after the verbatim-pointer guard):
   - canonical `(field,label)` → tallied `EvidenceRecord` (with the canonical label);
   - demographic (gender/age) → `deferred_signals` (transient Tier-2-A "reminder base", gated);
   - special-category (health/religion/politics/sexuality) → **hard reject** (Tier-3);
   - anything else → `other_candidates` **review telemetry** — never tallied, never a
     persisted profile label; surfaces candidate vocabulary for human admission.
4. **`other_candidate` is an escape, not a tally key.** A label outside the allow-list
   cannot reach a record by default — so a label that is not yet admitted is held for
   review rather than silently splitting or smuggling.

## Settled: do NOT collapse Tier-1 and Tier-2-A

The owner asked whether to collapse the tiers into one "allowed" space. **No.** This is
not a preference — the signed carve-out states *"the Tier-1 slice never votes gender"*
and confines the demographic prior *"to the Tier-2-A slice"* (carve-out, 2026-06-23).
Collapsing would route demographic inference through the Tier-1 exact-label tally with
no sourced base rate, no defeasibility, and no aggregate/transient handling —
contradicting a signed direction-lock and re-opening the demographic-label backdoor
that #368 closed. Tiers are **handling, not permission**: keeping them separate is what
lets a vibe's age-coding be *used* (as Tier-2-A evidence) instead of *leaked* (into Tier-1).

## Deferred (named residuals — mini-god-tier)

- **Schema-level `(field,label)` guard:** canonicalization is enforced at the
  extractor/router boundary (the only `EvidenceRecord` producer), not as a rigid schema
  constraint. Lower lock-in; the schema-level guard stays deferred until a second
  producer appears. *Residual:* a second producer could bypass canonicalization.
- **Alias map + denylist predicates are hand-maintained.** An un-aliased synonym falls
  to `other_candidate` until admitted; the demographic + special-category predicates can
  miss novel phrasings — they are the SECOND line behind the positive allow-list.
- **SubNiche hierarchy + `use_context` field:** deferred until evidence volume justifies
  them. Canonical+alias is the complete minimum now.
- **`aesthetic_vibe` field — deferred (not shipped v0).** Considered, then cut: it would be
  the thinnest field (frequent abstain), it overlaps `segment`/`price_tier`, and a text-only
  v0 cannot read a visual *aesthetic* reliably. Admission is left to evidence — the router's
  `other_candidates` telemetry surfaces mood-ish labels that don't fit the buckets, so a future
  mood field (or a Tier-2-A slang→age register signal) is admitted on data, not a guess.

## Tier-2-A demographics — sequencing to "live"

The owner wants gender/age live. The **legal gate is already cleared** (carve-out,
council-confirmed 2026-06-23). What remains is **build/data**, and it is its own slice
(not a fold into Tier-1):

1. a roster-ledger **aggregate-audience-attribute schema home** (the ledger currently
   forbids demographic fields);
2. a **sourced, versioned per-category base-rate table** (owner-supplied/approved; a
   general base rate is obtainable to start, refined over time);
3. a **defeasible-prior deciding module** — base rates applied **in code**, *"sourced +
   versioned (not model-gut)"*, that creator-specific content evidence updates and
   overrides, with prior-dominated vs evidence-dominated transparency.

The LLM only *labels* the demographic ballot (already quarantined into `deferred_signals`);
**code does the judging** — that is the anti-bias mechanism. Binding posture on activation
(carve-out): aggregate-only, text-only / no-biometric, legitimate-interests, transient with
no individual-follower retention, no special-category. *Residual:* early output is
prior-dominated until creator evidence accrues; a stale/wrong base rate biases
prior-dominated creators until overridden.

## What this record is not

Not validation, readiness, calibration, or buyer proof. Not Tier-2-A activation (its
build/data gates are open). Not a change to the carve-out or the spec — it adopts a
Tier-1 design within them. The profile always carries `actual_audience = not_estimated`;
this lane is never "gold" (gold = the Judgment layer).
