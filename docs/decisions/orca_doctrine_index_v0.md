# Orca Doctrine Index v0 (router, not authority)

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Doctrine index (router only — on conflict, each doctrine's own record wins and this index is the stale party)
scope: >
  One place to find every binding Orca doctrine: cross-cutting rules, lenses,
  and contracts agents and the owner must follow, scattered across the kernel,
  the overlay, decision records, and product lanes. Derived from a repo-wide
  sweep 2026-06-11. Lists and points; binds nothing itself.
use_when:
  - Finding whether a doctrine exists before authoring or re-deciding one.
  - Loading the owning doctrine for doctrine-changing work.
  - Registering a newly adopted doctrine (one row; owner-gated by the adoption itself).
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
open_next:
  - AGENTS.md                                   # kernel triggers (smallest complete; mini god tier)
  - .agents/workflow-overlay/README.md          # overlay authority entry
  - .agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md # source hierarchy + DCP contract
stale_if:
  - A doctrine is adopted, superseded, or dropped without a row update here.
  - review_by 2026-12-11 passes without an owner review of this index.
```

## Why an index of doctrines is allowed when a venue registry was not

This is a maintained list — the genus the venue-registry rejection killed. It
survives on a different profile: doctrines are FEW, change RARELY, and every
change is already owner-gated with its own ceremony (adoption records, DCP
receipts), so rows update as a side effect of changes that must be recorded
anyway. Owner: Eric. Review_by: 2026-12-11. A 13th+ row costs nothing — the
cap here is the doctrine-adoption ceremony itself, not a number.

## Decision-record doctrine (docs/decisions/)

| Doctrine | File | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mini God Tier Doctrine (record; kernel trigger above) | orca_mini_god_tier_doctrine_v0.md | OWNER-ADOPTED 2026-06-11 |
| Artifact Folders Doctrine — decision layer (subset) | orca_repo_structure_binding_v0.md | OWNER-AUTHORIZED v0 |
| Distillation Doctrine — adoption index + spine bindings | distillation_doctrine_orca_spine_bindings_v0.md | PREPARE-ONLY |
| Distillation Doctrine subset — enforcement-placement classification | overlay_enforcement_placement_classification_v0.md | PREPARE-ONLY (EP-01/03/06 substrates built) |
| Distillation Doctrine subset — overlay-governance binding | distillation_binding_overlay_governance_v0.md | PREPARE-ONLY DRAFT |
| Pre-sale execution evidence tiers | judgment_spine_pre_sale_execution_evidence_tier_policy_v0.md | ACTIVE |
| Deletion-Evidence Doctrine (governed-deletion safety; register + strict gate) | deletion_evidence_doctrine_v0.md | ACTIVE — `check_deletion_evidence.py --strict` in ci.yml; register `deletion_evidence_register_v0.yaml` |
| Ontology<->Runtime Drift-Check Contract (W2b leak-surface semantics) | ontology_runtime_drift_check_contract_v0.md | OWNER-RATIFIED 2026-06-19 — `check_ontology_drift.py --strict` in ci.yml |
| Repo-Map Architecture (Mini God Tier) — map/submap/header tiers + coverage invariant | orca_repo_map_architecture_mgt_v0.md | OWNER-INVOKED MGT DESIGN 2026-06-19 (design lens; reachability-coverage invariant gated by `check_map_links`) |

## Product-lane doctrine (docs/product/)

| Doctrine | File | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claim defense (external claims policy) | product_lead/orca_claim_defense_doctrine_v0.md | OWNER_SIGNED_OPERATIVE 2026-06-11 |
| Judgment-spine evidence ladder | judgment_spine/judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md | ACTIVE (claim-tier architecture) |
| Data-capture obligation contract | data_capture_spine/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_obligation_contract_v0.md | CONTRACT_DRAFT_V0 (doctrine-adjacent) |

## Dropped (do not re-open without a dated owner decision)

| Doctrine | File | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deleted-comment signal retrieval | docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_deleted_comment_signal_retrieval_scoped_doctrine_decision_v0.md | DROPPED 2026-06-08 (re-open guard) |

## Naming Note (owner-directed, 2026-06-11)

Rows above carry explicit "Doctrine" names per owner direction (SCI, MGT,
artifact folders, retrievability, decision routing, prompt orchestration,
review lanes, source loading, skill adoption; repo-structure binding subsumed
as the Artifact Folders Doctrine's decision layer; distillation grouped with
its subsets). Index-label renames only: the underlying FILES are not renamed —
overlay paths are load-bearing (hook configs, AGENTS.md, dozens of open_next
pointers reference them); a physical rename would be a propagation pass of its
own, owner-gated.

## Non-Claims

Router only: registration here is not adoption, validation, or authority —
each doctrine's own record and the overlay govern. Statuses above are as
reported by the 2026-06-11 sweep plus this lane's own session verifications
(MGT, retrieval-metadata, distillation index, folder binding, plus a 2026-06-20
reconciliation that added the deletion-evidence, ontology<->runtime drift-check,
and repo-map-architecture (MGT) rows from primary-source reads, with their gates
confirmed in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`); verify a status
against its record before relying on it for a strict claim.
