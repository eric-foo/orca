  - The creator metric seed or creator_profile_current view is regenerated without carrying sample_support and representativeness posture.
  - A later accepted Creator Signal surface changes thin-sample withhold/downgrade rules.
```

## Decision

`ACCEPT_WITH_FRICTION_PATCHED`.

The Chief Architect accepts the delegated review's recommendation as decision
input, not as automatic approval. Both findings are accepted with bounded
remediation:

1. **AR-01 accepted and patched.** The seed and profile export now name the
   representativeness residual: per-account average/median views are directional
   admitted-pool statistics, may be based on as few as one admitted Short, and
   are not representative creator/channel averages.
2. **AR-02 accepted and patched by caveat.** The absolute
   `source_packet_pointer_or_none` values remain as optional local-only
   drill-back, while portable provenance is explicitly bound to
   `source_pointer`, `source_field`, `source_file`, and
   `source_packet_id_or_none`.

## Kept Remediation

Kept changes:

- Added `sample_support` to each creator metric rollup, with
  `sample_adequacy`, `representativeness_posture`, and `surface_handling`.
- Mirrored `sample_support` and the representativeness limitations into
  `creator_profile_current_view_v0.json`.
- Added seed-level accepted residuals for small-n averages, admitted-pool
  selection bias, and local-only packet drill-back paths.
- Updated the Capture view spec to require sample support on metric rollups.
- Updated the Creator Signal surface to withhold or downgrade thin or
  admitted-pool-only influence summaries without visible limitation.
- Strengthened unit tests so the seed and profile export must preserve these
  fields and caveats.

No SQLite, data-lake writer, dashboard, live capture, engagement-rate support,
or creator-record cross-platform rollup was added.

## Validation

Fresh validation observed in this CA lane:

```

## Residual Risk

The rollups are still a static seed over checked-in capture artifacts. They are
source-backed observations, not proof of channel-wide influence, current live
views, engagement rate, buyer proof, dashboard readiness, or lake-native metric
storage. The sample-support labels are presentation guards, not statistical
validation.

## Non-Claims

This adjudication is not validation, readiness, buyer proof, SQLite adoption,
data-lake physicalization, dashboard implementation, live capture authorization,
source-access authorization, cross-platform identity linkage, or contact/outreach
authorization.
