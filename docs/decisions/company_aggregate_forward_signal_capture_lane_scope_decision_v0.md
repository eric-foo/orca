  Capture-lane ownership + scope decision for the source-agnostic company
  headcount-aggregate forward-trend signal (org-motion net-adds realization) —
  the sibling slice routed by the owner-locked architecture decision
  (company_aggregate_forward_signal_architecture_decision_v0.md). Fixes the
  entity-keyed time-series record shape, the official-first source-selection
  policy, the official adapter set and the separate source-access authorizations
  each one still needs, the attended-fallback cadence posture, and the LinkedIn
  extraction adapter's home (consume, not absorb). Surfaces the standing-capture
  obligation-home gap. Scope/ownership only; NOT a build authorization, NOT a

## Status

`CAPTURE_LANE_SCOPE_DECISION_v0` (2026-06-12, in-thread). Lane-owned scope.
**Owner-authorized to build (2026-06-12):** the slice build (#3) and the SEC
EDGAR source-access adapter (#2) are owner-authorized; the standing-capture
obligation home is clarified in the dated section below (discharging prerequisite
#1). Cadence is **manual-now**, the periodic scheduler deferred. Remaining
deferrals: the Companies House adapter, the commercial LinkedIn-provider adapter,
and any periodic-scheduler policy. Not validated, not readiness, not
source-of-truth promotion. A lane-scope label, not an evidence-ladder claim tier.

This record answers the cross-lane handoff from the LinkedIn / org-motion
discovery lane under the owner-locked parent decision. It does not edit the
parent. The build and EDGAR source-access authorizations were granted by the
owner in-thread (2026-06-12); this record **documents** that scope and is not
itself the authorizing instrument.

## Owner Refinements (2026-06-12)

Owner input received after this scope was first written. These **sharpen
Decisions 1, 4, 5, 6 and the prerequisites** and take precedence over the inline
wording where they differ.

1. **The obligation-home blocker is *doctrinal*, not legal (Decision 1 / Prereq 1).**
   Correction to the earlier framing: the blocker is **which obligation contract
   governs standing capture**, not legality. The legal / source-access posture is
   *favorable* — Companies House and SEC EDGAR are official public data, cleanly
   in-bounds; the LinkedIn fallback is company-aggregate-only and attended.
   Clearing it is a **clarification**, not necessarily a heavyweight new contract:
   either amend the v0 obligation contract to admit a standing-corpus path, or
   stand up the separate Candidate Signal Intake / Corpus Intake contract v0
   already points to. What is required is an **explicit obligation home**, however
   light.

2. **SEC EDGAR is the first official adapter (Decision 4 / Prereq 2).**
   Authorize + build **EDGAR first** as the reference official adapter; Companies
   House second. Consequence kept visible: EDGAR-first does **not** serve Beauty
   Pie #3 (UK -> Companies House) — consistent with "no urgency"; Companies House
   is sequenced second, **not dropped**, and remains the UK adapter.

3. **Slice build stays gated on #1 (Prereq 3).** Confirmed: the slice build
   authorization comes **after the obligation home is clarified**.

4. **LinkedIn employee-band extension is in-flight (Decision 6 / Prereq 4).**
   Reported by the LinkedIn lane: the `numberOfEmployees` + size-band extractor
   extension is **being built now** under that lane's own authorization. The
   consume path's upstream dependency is being satisfied — no longer a
   pending-unstarted blocker. This does not change the consume decision; it
   confirms the consumed input will exist.

5. **Manual now, structured for additive automation (Decision 5 / Prereq 5).**
   Cadence is **manual / attended for now**. Design constraint: structure the
   capture core so **manual -> automatic is additive** — a **trigger-agnostic
   capture entrypoint** that a manual trigger calls now and a future scheduler can
   call later without re-architecting. This collapses the high-lock-in worry: the
   scheduler becomes a thin add-on over the same entrypoint, not a structural
   change. Note the split — **structure is prepared now; the periodic-scheduler
   *policy* lock (especially periodic-LinkedIn) still defers to a later owner
   call.** Preparing the structure does not take the periodic decision.

## Build Authorization, Obligation Home & Probe Findings (2026-06-12)

Following the owner refinements above, the owner authorized the build and a
read-only EDGAR feasibility probe ran. Current state:

### Authorizations (owner, in-thread 2026-06-12)

- **#3 slice build — AUTHORIZED.** The source-agnostic core (trigger-agnostic
  entrypoint, append-only entity-keyed store, source-adapter interface,
  source-selection) may be built.
- **#2 SEC EDGAR source-access adapter — AUTHORIZED** as the first official
  adapter. EDGAR is official public data, cleanly in-bounds. (Companies House
  remains a separate, still-pending owner-named authorization.)

Bounded to the named scope: not a scheduler authorization, not a commercial-
routing authorization, not a Companies House authorization.

### Standing-capture obligation home (clarification — discharges Prereq #1)

Clarified **lightly and slice-scoped**, per the owner's "clarification, not a
heavyweight contract" call:

- The company-aggregate forward series is **standing / corpus capture** — it
  accretes entity-keyed observations on a cadence before any specific Decision
  Frame.
- It runs under the **existing v0 capture obligations** (minimization, boundary
  compliance, capture-event provenance, decomposed timing, archive/visibility
  posture, failure visibility), reusing the LinkedIn lane's `business_entity_only`
  minimization rails.
- **Rebind rule:** a standing observation row is **not ECR-ready evidence** until
  rebound or re-captured under a Decision Frame (the v0 contract's standing-capture
  carve-out). The series is a corpus that commissioned captures later draw from,
  not pre-cleared evidence.
- **Retention:** append-only; re-observations supplement, never overwrite.
- **Narrow to this slice.** It does not write the general Candidate Signal Intake
  / Corpus Intake contract the v0 contract points to (a future general contract
  may supersede this), and does not amend the v0 obligation-contract file.

> **Superseded as the obligation home (2026-06-15).** The general
> standing-capture / Corpus Intake obligation contract anticipated above is now
> owner-ratified:
> `docs/product/data_capture_spine/data_capture_spine_corpus_intake_obligation_contract_proposal_v0.md`
> (`CONTRACT_RATIFIED_V0_2026_06_15`). It is now the **obligation home** for this
> slice's standing capture, superseding this slice-scoped clarification in that
> role. The `stale_if` entry "A standing / corpus-capture obligation contract is
> accepted, giving this slice its obligation home" has **fired**. This
> clarification's content (existing v0 obligations + rebind rule + append-only)
> is consistent with, not contradicted by, the ratified contract; the
> org-motion record shape and official-first source selection remain owned here.

### EDGAR feasibility probe finding (read-only scouting, 2026-06-12)

**Finding: SEC EDGAR has no reliably-populated structured employee-count field.**
The DEI XBRL concept `dei:EntityNumberOfEmployees` returned **HTTP 404 for both
Apple (CIK 320193) and Microsoft (CIK 789019)** via the `companyconcept` API,
while a control concept (`dei:EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding`) returned 200 —
the endpoint works; the employee tag is unpopulated even for two of the most
thoroughly XBRL-tagged filers.

Implication: the EDGAR employee count lives in **10-K Item 1 "Human Capital"
narrative** (annual). The EDGAR adapter is therefore a **text-extraction adapter
over the 10-K at annual cadence** — still official and reliable, but heavier than
an API field and coarser (annual) than assumed.

**Sequencing — RESOLVED (owner, 2026-06-12): EDGAR-first confirmed** (US-leaning
coverage rationale), accepting narrative 10-K extraction; the EDGAR adapter is
authorized. Companies House is **second**, and its clean-structured-count
assumption stays **unverified** — a Companies House probe is deferred to its own
adapter authorization, not run now.

### ToS / commercial-scale posture (owner, 2026-06-12)

ToS risk is **accepted pre-commercial** for the LinkedIn fallback (attended,
low-volume, posture-tagged). At commercial scale the ToS-risky access **routes
through a commercial data provider (BrightData-style) that absorbs the ToS risk**;
Orca does not scale the attended-browser path itself. Design consequence: the
LinkedIn adapter is **thin and disposable** — the pre-commercial attended adapter
and a future provider-feed adapter are two implementations behind the same
source-adapter interface. Durable investment concentrates in the official
adapters (EDGAR/CH) + the core, which carry no ToS risk and are the permanent
surfaces.

## Inputs (source-loading, S-route bound)

- **Controlling authority:** `docs/decisions/company_aggregate_forward_signal_architecture_decision_v0.md` — owner-locked AO-3, official-first policy, core/satellite boundary, posture recommendation. This scope obeys it and does not reopen it.
- **Capture-lane obligation contract:** `docs/product/data_capture_spine/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_obligation_contract_v0.md` — the lane's minimization + obligation rails (reconciled below).
- **Source-access tooling authorization:** `docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_access_tooling_build_authorization_v0.md` — the tranche-gated, owner-named-adapter pattern the official adapters must follow.
- **LinkedIn extraction adapter (the thing to consume or absorb):** `orca-harness/capture_spine/linkedin_live_runtime/` (slice 3c-2b: `extract_company_signal` -> `CompanySignal`).
- **Discovery-tier input (weighed, not authority):** `docs/research/orgmotion_demand_signal_wedge_discovery_v0.md`.

---

## Decision 1 — Ownership: ACCEPT (with one load-bearing condition surfaced)

The capture lane **owns** the sibling company-aggregate forward-signal slice as
routed by the parent. It fits the lane's charter: a source-agnostic,
entity-keyed, official-first capture surface whose official adapters (Companies
House, SEC EDGAR) are capture-lane source surfaces, built against the same
Source Capture Packet / adapter shape the lane already uses.

**Condition surfaced — the obligation-home gap (the bottleneck).** The forward
*trend* is **standing / opportunistic capture**: it accretes an entity-keyed
time series on a cadence **before any specific Decision Frame exists**. The
lane's v0 obligation contract scopes **commissioned capture only** and
**explicitly routes standing / opportunistic corpus capture out** of v0 to "a
separate Candidate Signal Intake or Corpus Intake contract" — which **does not
yet exist**. Consequences:

- This slice's **obligation home is that not-yet-written standing-capture
  contract**, not the v0 commissioned-capture contract. Ownership is accepted;
  the obligation contract for it is a **prerequisite the owner must commission**
  before a clean build.
- Per v0, items captured under standing/corpus intake are **not ECR-ready
  evidence until rebound or recaptured under a Decision Frame**. The forward
  series is therefore a **standing corpus that later commissioned captures draw
  from**, not pre-cleared evidence. That is the correct shape for a
  "leading-indicator / corroboration" signal (per the discovery note), but it
  must be stated, not assumed.

This condition does not block authoring the scope; it blocks a clean build and
is flagged for the owner as the first prerequisite.

## Decision 2 — Record shape (capture-method level, NOT an ECR schema)

A **source-agnostic, entity-keyed observation series**. The atomic unit is one
**observation row**; the **trend** is the ordered set of rows per entity.

Per-observation facts to preserve:

- `entity_key` — a canonical-entity reference the **entity-resolution spine**
  owns and resolves (LinkedIn slug, Companies House number, CIK, brand-vs-parent
  surface forms map to it). Capture **carries** the key and the raw surface form;
  it does **not** invent canonical identity or roll up the brand->parent tree
  (the discovery note flags brand->parent as load-bearing in beauty; that is the
  entity spine's job, not Capture's).
- `numberOfEmployees` — integer, when an official source supplies it.
- `size_band` — coarse band (e.g. `10,001+`), when supplied.
- `follower_count` — coarse count/band, LinkedIn-only corroboration figure.
- `source` tag — `companies_house` | `sec_edgar` | `linkedin` (extensible).
- `capture_posture` tag — `official` | `attended_fallback` (carries the
  legally-defensible posture forward into the row, per the parent).
- **Decomposed timing** (Obligation 8, not one timestamp): source-effective /
  filing / as-of timing **vs** capture timing — divergence is the point for a
  trend.
- Access posture + provenance + visible limitations (Obligations 2, 3, 11, 14).

**Persistence = append-only.** A re-observation **supplements** the prior row
(it does not overwrite it); the trend is preserved (Obligation 15 re-capture
semantics — later access does not erase earlier observations). No single
"current headcount" cell that silently mutates.

Capture records visible facts only. This shape is **not** an ECR field
architecture, key design, table, or storage schema — defining those is a
forbidden Capture output and belongs downstream.

## Decision 3 — Source-selection policy: official-first (locked by parent)

Per entity, select the source in this order:

1. **Companies House** (UK) — official annual employee count, when the entity is
   UK-registered.
2. **SEC EDGAR** (US) — when the entity is US-public.
3. **LinkedIn** — **fallback only**, for **US-private / no-official-source**
   entities, under the attended posture (Decision 5).

Official and LinkedIn rows for the same entity are both retained and
**source-tagged**; the policy chooses the **preferred** row for a given read, it
does not delete the others. The parent locks official-first and LinkedIn-as-least-
defensible; this decision only operationalizes the ordering.

## Decision 4 — Official adapters need their OWN source-access authorizations (NOT granted here)

Companies House and SEC EDGAR are the **preferred** surfaces, and both are
official / disclosable surfaces that sit well inside the unchanged source-access
boundary — a **favorable** posture for a future authorization. But each is a
**new source-access surface** and a **new owner-named adapter**. Under the
existing tooling-build authorization, "additional owner-named source adapters"
are built against the shared packet/adapter contract **only when the owner names
and authorizes them**.

Therefore: **each official adapter (Companies House, SEC EDGAR) requires its own
bounded source-access / build authorization** that names the adapter, the source
family, the access method, the risk posture, and non-claims. This scope decision
**does not** grant them, and does **not** assert either adapter is feasible or
implemented — adapter feasibility (API shape, employee-count availability,
archival/backtest posture) is a build-time verification item, not a claim made
here.

## Decision 5 — Cadence + persistence posture (recommendation carried; high-lock-in axis deferred)

- **LinkedIn fallback:** **attended / low-frequency, posture-tagged — NOT a
  periodic-default scheduler.** Carried verbatim from the parent's posture
  recommendation; it preserves the legally-defensible posture and matches the
  existing attended runtime (the 3c-2b `CdpAttachBrowserDriver` is owner-validated
  and behind the legal/ToS gate).
- **Official adapters:** the official surfaces are inherently low-frequency
  (annual / periodic filings); they are the natural periodic surface and carry
  far lower posture risk than periodic LinkedIn. This decision still does **not**
  lock a scheduler for them.
- **High-lock-in axis, deferred:** a periodic-default **scheduler** (any source,
  LinkedIn especially) is the high-lock-in, owner-flagged axis. Per the parent,
  the final cadence call is the capture lane's **build-time** decision and the
  owner may override then. **Scope-time default = attended / manual-trigger,
  posture-tagged**; the scheduler lock is **not** taken here. This is the single
  line to flip if the owner later accepts a periodic-LinkedIn lock-in for the
  US-private gap.

Standing capture (Decision 1) also routes the cadence question through the
not-yet-written standing-capture obligation contract — another reason not to lock
a scheduler now.

## Decision 6 — LinkedIn extraction adapter home: CONSUME, not absorb

The LinkedIn lane recommends handing its 3c-2b extraction adapter to the capture
lane. **This decision keeps it in the LinkedIn lane and consumes its output.**

- The owner-locked parent **core/satellite table assigns "LinkedIn company-page
  extraction" to the LinkedIn lane.** Absorbing the adapter into the capture
  lane's adapter set would **re-assign an owner-locked boundary** — not a
  capture-lane scope decision's call. Consuming needs no boundary change.
- **Lower downstream lock-in** (the Smallest Complete Intervention tie-breaker):
  the LinkedIn fallback is rarely hit (US-private only; not even needed for
  Beauty Pie #3). Moving its code into the capture lane is premature
  consolidation; consuming keeps absorb available later if the owner re-assigns
  the boundary.
- **Respects the existing one-way import discipline** (`runtime -> adapter ->
  core`) and the lane's minimization gate. The capture lane consumes the
  **already-minimized, gate-passed** observation the LinkedIn lane emits
  (`extract_company_signal` -> `CompanySignal`, then the lane's
  `minimize_capture_to_observation` -> validated `LiveObservation`). It does
  **not** reach into LinkedIn itself.

**Consume mechanics:** the capture lane's source-agnostic core treats the
LinkedIn lane's minimized employee-aggregate observation as **one source-adapter
input behind the same interface** as the Companies House / EDGAR adapters,
tagged `source=linkedin`, `capture_posture=attended_fallback`.

**Dependency to record:** the parent says the LinkedIn adapter still **needs
`numberOfEmployees` + size band added** (the 3c-2b extractor today pulls
`display_name` + follower band and **defers** employee-band extraction). That
extension is the **LinkedIn lane's own pending build** under its own
authorization — a **prerequisite of the consume path**, owned there, not here.

If the owner prefers consolidation, **absorb** is the alternative — but it
re-assigns the owner-locked core/satellite boundary and is not needed now;
surfaced, not taken.

## Minimization reconciliation (against the lane's obligation contract)

Reconciled and **consistent**. The slice is **company-aggregate only**: a
business entity's employee count, size band, and a coarse follower figure — no
individuals, no senior-moves roster, no follower/connection lists, no graphs, no
profile/post content. This sits inside the lane's Boundary Compliance
(Obligation 2) and matches the LinkedIn adapter's already-built `business_entity_only`
rails (the 3c-2b extractor fail-closes out of the social-proof / person region by
construction, and the read-time minimizer default-denies every non-`LiveObservation`
field). The minimization the handoff asks for is the minimization the lane
already enforces; ownership does not loosen it.

## Beauty Pie #3 reality check (carried)

Forward LinkedIn does **not** serve Beauty Pie #3 — a past *UK* case whose
net-adds proxy is **Companies House**, not a go-forward LinkedIn signal. This
slice is **go-forward realization for future cases**; there is **no urgency**
forcing the high-lock-in periodic / scheduled path (LinkedIn or otherwise) now.
The lowest-lock-in moves (official-first, attended fallback, consume-not-absorb,
scheduler deferred) are therefore the correct scope-time defaults.

## Owner prerequisites (what must exist before a clean build)

> **Status (2026-06-12):** #1 clarified above (slice-scoped, light); #2 (SEC
> EDGAR) and #3 authorized; #4 in-flight in the LinkedIn lane; #5 manual-now
> (scheduler deferred). The original framing below is retained for context — the
> dated section above carries current state.

1. A **standing / corpus-capture obligation contract** (the Candidate Signal
   Intake / Corpus Intake contract v0 routes to) — this slice's obligation home.
2. A **per-adapter source-access / build authorization** for Companies House,
   and another for SEC EDGAR.
3. The **build authorization** for the slice itself (record/persistence/cadence).
4. The **LinkedIn lane's** `numberOfEmployees` + size-band extension build (the
   consume path's upstream dependency), under the LinkedIn lane's own authorization.
5. A **cadence/scheduler decision** if any periodic-default is wanted (the
   high-lock-in line).

## Non-Claims

Scope / ownership only. **Not** a build authorization, **not** a source-access
authorization (the official adapters each need their own), **not** owner-locked,
**not** an amendment to the capture-lane obligation contract (the standing-capture
gap is surfaced, not closed), **not** an ECR field/key/schema/storage design,
**not** a cadence/scheduler lock, **not** validation, readiness, or buyer-proof.
Does not assert Companies House or SEC EDGAR adapter feasibility — that is a
build-time verification item. Does not change the LinkedIn lane's obligation
contract or its ownership of the extraction adapter.

## Direction Change Propagation

> probe finding on top of the original scope. The receipt below records the
