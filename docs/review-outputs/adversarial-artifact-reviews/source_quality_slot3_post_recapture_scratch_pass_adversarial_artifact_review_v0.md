## Section 1 — Pre-Review Preflight

### 1.1 Repository and Branch

- Working directory: `C:\Users\vmon7\Desktop\projects\orca`
- Branch: `main`
- HEAD short: `8915d02` (verified against commissioning expectation)
- Dirty-state allowance: repo broadly dirty with unrelated modified and untracked files; allowed per commissioning prompt. Review target files are under `orca-harness/_test_runs/` (ignored/scratch path). No review target file appears in the dirty-state set.
- Review is read-only. No edits, no staged changes, no commits.

### 1.2 Skills and Disciplines Loaded

- `workflow-deep-thinking`: loaded and active. Deep-thinking discipline applied throughout.
- `workflow-adversarial-artifact-review`: loaded and active. Adversarial review flow followed.

### 1.3 Output Mode Binding

- Output mode: `filesystem-output`
- Destination: `docs/review-outputs/adversarial-artifact-reviews/source_quality_slot3_post_recapture_scratch_pass_adversarial_artifact_review_v0.md`
- Directory verified to exist before writing.

### 1.4 Trigger and Lane

- Trigger: explicit adversarial artifact review commission with named review target, source basis, SHA256 hashes, and required output path.
- Lane: adversarial artifact review of non-code outputs (YAML scratch queue, report blocks, state census, packet manifests, skeletons).
- Lane collision: none. No implementation review, installed-copy review, postmortem, or prompt-orchestration scope.

## Section 5 — Review: Ten Commission Questions

### Q1 — Local-Only Boundary

**Verdict: No boundary violation observed.**

Every output file, non-claim, and manifest receipt is bounded to already-local operator-supplied files. The manifests for all three packets declare `operator_category: codex_local_scratch_operator` and `capture_mode: mixed` (referring to the mixed file types within the local packet, not mixed live/local acquisition).

The `non_claims` blocks in `queue.yaml`, `mini_god_tier_report_blocks.yaml`, `state_census.yaml`, and all three skeletons consistently exclude:
- not source acquisition
- not live source acquisition
- not Reddit API use / not browser automation (per source type)
- not direct HTTP fetch
- not archive retrieval
- not ECR design
- not Cleaning implementation
- not Judgment scoring
- not buyer proof
- not commercial-readiness logic

The recapture step receipt (`slot3_recapture_step_01_05_receipt.md`) confirms the media download and WSO visible-page envelope captures were executed as prior pre-packet operator work; the scratch pass consumes these already-local results without re-executing any acquisition. No output implies discovery, API use, browser automation beyond what was already local, or any downstream pipeline output.

**No critical, major, or minor finding on Q1.**

---

### Q2 — Source Unit Identity Boundary

**Verdict: All three units correctly bounded.**

The queue, report blocks, state census, and all three skeletons use exactly:
- `S3-REDDIT-B1`
- `S3-REDDIT-B2`
- `S3-WSO`

No additional or conflated source IDs appear. B1 covers R01–R05 and B2 covers R06–R10, drawing from the same physical `slot3_reddit_b1` inbox directory but correctly identified as separate source units with different locator qualifiers ("rows R06-R10" for B2). WSO is separately bounded as `wso_forum_visible_envelope`. No unit boundary leakage.

**No finding on Q2.**

---

### Q3 — Mini God-Tier Token Defensibility

**Verdict: `mini_god_tier_with_visible_limitations` is defensible for all three rows. No downgrade is warranted.**

Profile criterion check against `source_quality_mini_god_tier_profile_v0.md`:

**Criterion 1 — Best in-bound body possession:**
- B1: Raw JSON files (02–06: 298KB, 304KB, 105KB, 43KB, 66KB), readable views (07–11), and media images (13–20) are present in the packet. Body is possessed. The `best_in_bound_body` pointer (discussed under Minor Finding AR-01) is to the capture session doc, but the actual body files are also in the packet.
- B2: Same structure (raw JSON 02–06, readable 07–11, media 13–14). Body possessed.
- WSO: Seven HTML files (each ~200KB, capped), seven text excerpts, seven screenshots, and receipt are present. Visible body is possessed within the access boundary (no login, no hidden content).

**Criterion 2 — Identity and provenance:**
All three packets provide `original_locator` (known), `final_or_snapshot_locator` (known), `access_status` (known), `content_type` (unknown_with_reason — acceptable per profile), `byte_count` (known), `sha256` (known), and `capture_time` (known). Source publication times marked `unknown_with_reason` with explanation (multiple threads). ✓

**Criterion 3 — Source-language anchors:**
B1: five anchors (R01–R05). B2: five anchors (R06–R10, corrected titles — see Q6). WSO: seven anchors (WSO-01–WSO-07). All bounded. ✓

**Criterion 4 — Coverage or drift note:**
All three rows provide coverage/drift notes describing the supplementation posture and what was not replaced. ✓

**Criterion 5 — Visible limitations:**
All three rows carry limitations correctly (see Q7). ✓

**Criterion 6 — Lifecycle state:**
All three output as `scratch`. ✓

Alternative token consideration: `current_body_standardized_only` does not apply (body possession is not limited to a current-live snapshot without historical depth; raw JSON is the actual source). `archive_body_not_preserved` does not apply (archive body is a known limitation but the in-bound posture of the bodies that ARE present is the best achievable within the local-only boundary). `body_possession_not_proven` does not apply (raw JSON and HTML files are in the packet). `visible_stop` does not apply (no missing gate-critical input was encountered).

For S3-REDDIT-B2: the mixed direct/adjacent/older/UK-DACH context limitation is material but is correctly carried as a visible limitation, not concealed. This does not justify downgrade below `mini_god_tier_with_visible_limitations` since the body IS possessed and the limitation travels forward.

**No finding on Q3.** The minor `best_in_bound_body` pointer issue (AR-01) does not change the token classification.

---

### Q4 — Skeleton `best_in_bound_body` Choice

**Finding AR-01 (Minor — Correctness).** See Section 6.

The skeleton helper selects `raw/01_*` (the capture session Markdown document) as `best_in_bound_body` for all three units. This is the first non-metadata file in each packet but is a capture session summary instrument rather than the primary source body.

- For B1 and B2: the raw Reddit JSON files (files 02–06) and readable views (07–11) are the actual source bodies. The capture session doc (file_01) is a structured operator assessment, not the Reddit thread content.
- For WSO: the HTML files (files 05, 08, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23) and text excerpts + screenshots are the actual visible-body evidence. The capture session doc (file_01, 23,388 bytes) understates the body volume when the HTML files are each ~200KB.

Does this create a substantive false body-possession claim? No. The actual body files ARE present in the packet, the `result_token_finalization: operator_review_required` gate is correctly set, and the `suggested_result_token_reason` explicitly says "manifest-only evidence cannot finalize all Mini God-Tier criteria." The pointer choice is suboptimal but does not misrepresent possession because the manifest makes all preserved files visible.

However, before durable closeout, the `best_in_bound_body` should be corrected to point to the primary source body (e.g., the raw JSON for Reddit, or one of the HTML files for WSO), with a note about the companion files. Leaving the capture session doc as the sole `best_in_bound_body` pointer in a durable artifact would create an inspectability gap.

---

### Q5 — Scratch Lifecycle Containment

**Verdict: Lifecycle correctly contained. No leakage observed.**

Every output object uses `lifecycle_state: scratch` or `packet_lifecycle: scratch`. The run directory is `orca-harness/_test_runs/` (an ignored/scratch path). The non_claims in all five output files explicitly exclude fixture admission, validation, source completeness proof, and source acquisition. The `notes` fields in `queue.yaml` state "scratch source-quality queue row only; not fixture admission or source completeness proof."

The state census's `non_claims` extend to:
- not source discovery
- not runner dispatch
- not source acquisition
- not source-quality scoring
- not Judgment scoring

No output promotes `_test_runs/` artifacts into durable evidence, fixture admission, validation, ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment. No lifecycle leak.

**Finding AR-02 (Minor — Correctness).** See Section 6. The `operator_finalization` field label in `mini_god_tier_report_blocks.yaml` warrants attention before durable closeout, but does not constitute a lifecycle leak in the current scratch context.

---

### Q6 — Reddit Batch 2 Source-Language Anchors

**Verdict: Corrected B2 titles are correctly preserved across all outputs.**

All five review target outputs (`queue.yaml`, `mini_god_tier_report_blocks.yaml`, `state_census.yaml`, `s3_reddit_b2_skeleton.yaml`, and the B2 packet manifest) consistently carry the following anchors for S3-REDDIT-B2:

- R06 OP: Non-target freshman trying to break into IB needing advice ✓
- R07 OP: Non-target junior getting mass rejected from everything. It's over. ✓
- R08 OP: Non-Target Junior, Resume Feedback ✓
- R09 OP: Rejected due to my educational background ✓
- R10 OP: Speedrunning rejections (0 interviews) - Off-cycle IB/PE UK & DACH - CV review ✓

These match the commissioning prompt's expected corrected titles exactly. No anchor mismatch, no stale pre-correction titles, no cross-batch contamination.

**No finding on Q6.**

---

### Q7 — Visible Limitations Completeness

**Verdict: All limitations are present and complete for this scratch pass.**

**S3-REDDIT-B1:**
- ✓ Local JSON cutoff remains operative; no live Reddit continuation was attempted
- ✓ Deleted rows and one R01 empty `more` placeholder remain visible limitations
- ✓ Archive body retrieval was not attempted

These three limitations match the commissioning prompt checklist exactly and are consistently carried across queue, report_blocks, state_census, and skeleton.

**S3-REDDIT-B2:**
- ✓ Original operator acquisition timing is not separately logged per thread beyond supplied file state
- ✓ Owner-supplied set mixes direct-frame, adjacent, older, and UK/DACH context
- ✓ Archive body retrieval was not attempted

These match the commissioning prompt checklist exactly.

**S3-WSO:**
- ✓ Full WSO comment graph is not preserved
- ✓ Hidden or comment-unlocked material is not captured
- ✓ Archive body retrieval was not attempted
- ✓ Visible HTML files may be capped near 200KB; text excerpts and screenshots carry page evidence

All four WSO limitations are consistently present. The manifest confirms that all seven WSO HTML files are exactly 200,019 bytes (with WSO-07 at 200,023 bytes), confirming that the "capped near 200KB" limitation is an observed fact, not a speculative note.

**No finding on Q7.** Advisory observation AR-04 (see Section 6) notes a durable closeout action for the WSO HTML cap.

---

### Q8 — State Assembler and `operator_review_required` Preservation

**Verdict: State assembler correctly preserves `operator_review_required` throughout.**

The `state_census.yaml` — which is the assembler's primary output — carries:
- `result_token_finalization: operator_review_required` for all three rows
- `operator_finalization_required_count: 3`
- `suggested_result_token` (not `result_token`) in all three rows, making clear these are helper suggestions, not finalized verdicts

No row in the state census converts a helper suggestion into a final automated verdict. The assembler does not claim `mini_god_tier_met` or any terminal lifecycle state.

**Finding AR-02 (Minor — Correctness):** In `mini_god_tier_report_blocks.yaml`, the field `operator_finalization: accepted_helper_suggestion_with_visible_limitations` uses language that could be misread as a formal finalization event, especially if the report_blocks are later extracted or cited in isolation. The current scratch lifecycle and non_claims adequately contain this within this file, but the field label creates an ambiguity that could cause a downstream reader to interpret "accepted" as an authorized finalization rather than an operator noting "I accept the helper's scratch suggestion for inspection purposes." This should be resolved before durable closeout either by relabeling the field or adding an explicit clarification that this is scratch-provisional acceptance, not a formal lifecycle decision.

---

### Q9 — Sufficiency of Single Review Pass

**Verdict: This adversarial review before durable closeout is sufficient for the scratch pass. A second review is appropriate — but not currently required — after a durable closeout artifact is written.**

The scratch pass has no lifecycle authority beyond being input to the operator's own judgment. It cannot self-promote to fixture admission, validation, or Judgment. The two minor carries (AR-01, AR-02) are inspectability issues that would affect durable closeout quality but do not block the scratch pass's use as input.

If a durable source-quality closeout artifact is subsequently written (e.g., promoting packets from scratch to candidate_evidence or recommended_fixture_admission), a second adversarial review of that closeout artifact is appropriate to verify that:
1. The `best_in_bound_body` pointers have been corrected.
2. The `operator_finalization` ambiguity has been resolved.
3. The lifecycle promotion is properly bounded.
4. No new lifecycle authority claims appear.

**No finding on Q9.** Recommendation below covers the two-phase closeout path.

---

### Q10 — Smallest Complete Carry

**Verdict: Two minor carries before durable closeout. No blocking carries for use of this scratch pass as input to the next checkpoint.**

The scratch pass is ready to serve as input to the operator's review, a combined state assessment, or next-checkpoint planning. The following carries apply before converting any of these scratch artifacts to a durable source-quality closeout:

**Minor carry 1 (from AR-01):** Correct `best_in_bound_body` pointer in all three skeletons from the capture session doc (file_01) to the primary source body or body-equivalent: raw JSON for Reddit (e.g., file_02–06 with a representative primary), or one of the HTML/screenshot/text-excerpt combinations for WSO. If the capture session doc is retained as a proxy, add explicit documentation that it functions as an evidence-summary pointer and cite the body-equivalent files separately.

**Minor carry 2 (from AR-02):** In `mini_god_tier_report_blocks.yaml`, clarify the `operator_finalization` field. Before durable closeout, this should either be renamed (e.g., `scratch_helper_token_status`) or accompanied by an explicit note that `accepted_helper_suggestion_with_visible_limitations` denotes scratch-provisional acceptance pending the `operator_review_required` gate, not a formal lifecycle finalization.

**Advisory carry 3 (from AR-03):** Resolve `content_type: unknown_with_reason` before durable closeout. Content types are inferrable from file extensions and MIME types in the manifest (JSON, Markdown, JPEG, PNG, HTML). Providing declared content types would strengthen the provenance record.

**Advisory carry 4 (from AR-04):** During durable closeout, explicitly confirm that the text excerpts and screenshots for WSO provide adequate coverage of the HTML content that was likely truncated at the ~200KB cap, or carry forward that coverage uncertainty as an explicit limitation.

---

## Section 6 — Findings

### AR-01 — Minor — Correctness

**Phase:** Correctness

**Artifact:** `skeletons/s3_reddit_b1_skeleton.yaml`, `skeletons/s3_reddit_b2_skeleton.yaml`, `skeletons/s3_wso_skeleton.yaml`; reflected in `state_census.yaml`

**Anchor:** `best_in_bound_body.preserved_body_path: raw/01_*` in all three skeletons

**Source authority:** `source_quality_mini_god_tier_profile_v0.md` — "The strongest appropriate source body or body-equivalent has been preserved within the source-access boundary"

**Evidence:**
- B1 skeleton: `best_in_bound_body.preserved_body_path = raw/01_data_capture_spine_pressure_test_slot_3_reddit_batch_1of2_...v0.md` (25,797 bytes) — this is the capture session document, not the Reddit thread body. The packet also contains raw JSON files (files 02–06: 298KB, 304KB, 105KB, 43KB, 66KB) and readable views (07–11).
- B2 skeleton: same pattern (19,246 bytes capture session doc; raw JSON 02–06 also present).
- WSO skeleton: `best_in_bound_body.preserved_body_path = raw/01_data_capture_spine_pressure_test_slot3_wso_capture_session_v0.md` (23,388 bytes). The packet also contains seven HTML files (~200KB each), seven text excerpts, seven screenshots, and a receipt.
- The skeleton helper chose file_01 (first non-metadata file) as the default body path — this is a heuristic, not an authoritative body selection.

**Impact:** Does not create a false body-possession claim for this scratch pass because (a) operator_review_required is correctly set, (b) the manifest makes all actual body files visible, and (c) the `suggested_result_token_reason` explicitly disclaims manifest-only finalization. However, if the skeleton's `best_in_bound_body` value is carried forward into a durable closeout without correction, a downstream reader inspecting only the top-level field would see a 23KB or 25KB summary doc as the primary body pointer, potentially underrepresenting the body evidence volume, especially for WSO where the HTML files are each ~200KB.

**Minimum closure condition:** Before any durable closeout artifact is written, `best_in_bound_body` in each skeleton or equivalent durable report block should be corrected to point to the primary source body (raw JSON for Reddit; HTML or text-excerpt for WSO) or the capture session doc should be explicitly documented as a summary pointer with the body-equivalent files enumerated separately.

**Next authorized action:** Operator review and pointer correction in any durable closeout artifact. No edit to the current scratch files required.

**Patch queue:** Not authorized for scratch pass review output; advisory direction only.

**Red-green proof:** not_applicable (non-executable artifact finding).

**Strict claim:** `not proven` — whether the current file_01 pointer is acceptable as the durable body pointer cannot be asserted without operator decision.

### AR-02 — Minor — Correctness

**Phase:** Correctness

**Artifact:** `mini_god_tier_report_blocks.yaml`

**Anchor:** `operator_finalization: accepted_helper_suggestion_with_visible_limitations` (three rows)

**Source authority:** `source_quality_mini_god_tier_profile_v0.md` — lifecycle states and operator review semantics; `state_census.yaml` — `result_token_finalization: operator_review_required` preserved in all three rows

**Evidence:**
- `mini_god_tier_report_blocks.yaml` uses `operator_finalization: accepted_helper_suggestion_with_visible_limitations` alongside `result_token: mini_god_tier_with_visible_limitations` and `lifecycle_state: scratch`.
- The state_census.yaml preserves `result_token_finalization: operator_review_required` with `operator_finalization_required_count: 3`.
- Tension: the report_blocks field says "accepted" (suggesting a decision was made) while the state_census says "operator_review_required" (suggesting a decision is still needed). Both use `lifecycle_state: scratch` and non_claims correctly.

**Impact:** Within this scratch pass, the `lifecycle_state: scratch` and non_claims adequately prevent misuse. However, the field label `operator_finalization` carries the connotation of a completed finalization event. If these report_blocks are cited in isolation (e.g., in a summary note or durable checkpoint reference), a reader might interpret "operator_finalization: accepted_helper_suggestion_with_visible_limitations" as the operator having formally accepted and finalized the token — which would conflict with the gate that the token still requires independent operator review against the Mini God-Tier profile before durable promotion.

**Minimum closure condition:** Before durable closeout, either (a) rename the field to `scratch_helper_token_status` or `scratch_operator_provisional_acceptance` or similar, or (b) add an explicit annotation in the field value or adjacent field stating this is scratch-provisional acceptance, not a formal lifecycle finalization. The `operator_review_required` gate must remain unambiguously live until an authorized operator explicitly closes it in a durable artifact.

**Next authorized action:** Field clarification in the durable closeout artifact (or in an updated version of the report_blocks if promoted). No edit to the current scratch file required.

**Patch queue:** Not authorized.

**Red-green proof:** not_applicable.

### AR-03 — Advisory

**Phase:** Friction

**Artifact:** All three packet manifests and skeletons

**Anchor:** `content_type: unknown_with_reason: content type not present in manifest metadata`

**Source authority:** `source_quality_mini_god_tier_profile_v0.md` — "content type...are recorded or marked unknown with reason"

**Evidence:** All three skeletons and manifests use the `unknown_with_reason` declaration. The file types are in fact inferrable from the manifest's `relative_packet_path` values: `.json`, `.md`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.html`, `.txt`. The manifest does not expose a MIME type field, making the `unknown_with_reason` declaration technically correct under the manifest schema.

**Impact:** Before durable closeout, explicit content type declarations (JSON, Markdown, JPEG, PNG, HTML, text/plain) per file or per source slice would strengthen provenance and reduce reader ambiguity about what was actually preserved. This is avoidable friction, not a correctness failure.

**Minimum closure condition:** Durable closeout notes or corrects the content types per file group.

**Next authorized action:** Durable closeout author to record or note.

---

### AR-04 — Advisory

**Phase:** Friction

**Artifact:** WSO packet manifest, `s3_wso_skeleton.yaml`, and `queue.yaml` (WSO row)

**Anchor:** `visible_limitations: visible HTML files may be capped near 200KB`

**Source authority:** WSO manifest — all seven HTML files show byte counts of exactly 200,019 bytes (WSO-01 through WSO-06) and 200,023 bytes (WSO-07), confirming the cap is real and consistent.

**Evidence:** The stated limitation "visible HTML files may be capped near 200KB; text excerpts and screenshots carry page evidence" is accurate. The manifest confirms the cap: six HTML files at exactly 200,019 bytes and one at 200,023 bytes — a clear browser-imposed cap artifact. The text excerpts (files 06, 09, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24) range from ~4,000 to ~4,037 bytes and the screenshots are full-page PNGs of varying sizes (841KB to 8MB).

**Impact:** For durable closeout, the operator should explicitly assess whether the text excerpts and screenshots provide coverage of the HTML content that was truncated, or whether the truncation boundary falls within content-dense sections that the excerpts do not cover. This is especially relevant for longer WSO threads (WSO-04 is associated with an 8MB screenshot, suggesting a longer page).

**Minimum closure condition:** Durable closeout includes an explicit statement on whether text excerpt + screenshot coverage is assessed as adequate for the truncated HTML sections.

**Next authorized action:** Durable closeout author to assess and document.

## Section 9 — Recommendation

**`accept_scratch_pass_with_minor_carries`**

This scratch pass is safe to use as input to a durable source-quality closeout or next-checkpoint planning. No finding rises to critical or major severity. The two minor carries (AR-01: `best_in_bound_body` pointer correction; AR-02: `operator_finalization` field ambiguity resolution) must be addressed before any durable closeout artifact is written that promotes or cites these results. The two advisory carries (AR-03: content type resolution; AR-04: WSO HTML cap coverage confirmation) are useful-but-not-blocking durable closeout improvements.

The scratch pass correctly:
- Stays within the local-only boundary throughout
- Bounds the three source units correctly
- Applies defensible `mini_god_tier_with_visible_limitations` tokens
- Preserves all required visible limitations
- Maintains `operator_review_required` as the active gate
- Contains lifecycle to `scratch` with complete non_claims
- Correctly reports corrected Reddit B2 source-language anchors

---

## Section 10 — Non-Claims

This review is not:
- validation of the source units
- fixture admission or recommendation
- source completeness proof
- ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment output
- authorization to promote scratch artifacts to any durable lifecycle state
- a pass/fail verdict on the Mini God-Tier result tokens (those require operator review against the profile)
- a second adversarial review of any future durable closeout artifact

Findings are decision input for the authorized decision-maker. Only a separately authorized patch, acceptance, or lifecycle decision lane can make remediation mandatory.

---

## Section 11 — Next Authorized Step

1. Operator reviews `suggested_result_token` for each row against `source_quality_mini_god_tier_profile_v0.md` (the `operator_review_required` gate).
2. Address AR-01: correct `best_in_bound_body` pointers before durable closeout artifact is written.
3. Address AR-02: clarify `operator_finalization` field before durable closeout artifact is written.
4. Address AR-03 and AR-04 as part of durable closeout artifact preparation.
5. If a durable source-quality closeout artifact is written, commission a second adversarial artifact review of that closeout artifact.
