## Method and Boundary

- `workflow-deep-thinking` invoked before source preflight. Pre-framed failure modes: false-clearance leakage, closeout-state over/under-statement, authority leak, stale provenance, and cross-file divergence.
- `SOURCE_CONTEXT_READY` declared after the required hashes, source pack, target completeness, and path-collision checks were complete.
- `workflow-adversarial-artifact-review` invoked after `SOURCE_CONTEXT_READY`.
- Review lane: adversarial artifact review, read-only for reviewed artifacts.
- Output mode: filesystem-output to the commissioned path above.
- Patch queue: not authorized. Findings below give advisory remediation direction only.
- Review result boundary: this report is findings-only decision input. It is not approval, validation, gate clearance, mandatory remediation, source-of-truth promotion, or executor-ready patch authority.

No required hash mismatch was observed. No `BLOCKED_SOURCE_REVISION_MISMATCH`.

Dirty-state limit: the worktree is dirty. Overlay authority sources are modified, product-proof and several Judgment Spine sources are untracked, and the target case/review artifacts are untracked under `docs/research/` and `docs/review-outputs/`. The commission allows these case artifacts as claim-discipline context only. Advisory review findings proceed from verified filesystem hashes and repo-visible text; strict validation, readiness, acceptance, source-of-truth, buyer-proof, fixture-admission, scoring, and judgment-quality claims remain not proven.

Sources available but not loaded: the lower-level Canoo/Walmart case artifacts cited by the JSG-08 receipt (`blind_judgments_v0.md`, `owner_context_judgments_v0.md`, `pre_reveal_judgment_comparison_v0.md`, `facilitator_ledger_v0.md`, `reveal_readout_v0.md`, `outcome_calibration_v0.md`). They were not required to decide the commissioned schema, closeout-state, and cross-file boundary questions because the JSG-08 receipt carries the case-specific hash references and the commission bounded this review to the JSG-09/JSG-10 record plus named companions.

## Trigger, Lane, and Output Gates

- Trigger gate: passed. The commission explicitly requested adversarial artifact review and named `workflow-adversarial-artifact-review`.
- Lane collision: none. The target is a non-code Research artifact. No implementation/code, resolver, installed-copy, prompt-authoring, postmortem, validation, scoring, model execution, or patch execution review is in scope.
- Artifact-role gate: passed. Target declares `artifact_role: Research artifact`; this report is a `Review report` under the accepted adversarial-review output folder.
- Output gate: passed. `filesystem-output` and required output path were bound by the commission; the path did not already exist before writing.

## Review Scope

In scope:
- Schema fidelity of the `judgment_spine_claim_classification` record.
- Correctness of `closeout_state: unreceipted_product_learning_context`.
- Correct identification of JSG-04, JSG-06, and JSG-07 as blocking gates.
- Claim-cap and non-claim boundary control.
- Provenance honesty for the JSG-08 receipt, JSG-08 post-patch recheck, case index, manifest, evidence ladder, and gate map references.
- Retrieval header, start preflight, cross-file consistency, and target completeness.

Excluded:
- Edits to reviewed artifacts.
- Patch queues or executor-ready patch instructions.
- JSG-07 scoring, fixture admission, model/probe execution, validation, readiness, buyer proof, judgment-quality proof, source-of-truth promotion, commits, pushes, or PRs.
- Re-litigating prior JSG-08 AR-01 through AR-06 findings except where this target restates them.

## Phase 1 - Correctness Findings

### AR-01 - Major - Schema key drift hides the required `weakest_missing_or_failed_gate` field

Artifact role: Research artifact.

Location anchor: `docs/research/judgment-spine/cases/canoo-walmart/jsg_09_10_claim_classification_closeout_v0.md`, `judgment_spine_claim_classification` block, line 152, key `weakest_missing_or_failed_gates`.

Source authority: `docs/product/judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md` lines 279-287 define the durable classification record shape and name `weakest_missing_or_failed_gate` singular. `docs/product/judgment_spine_gate_ownership_map_v0.md` line 127 likewise describes the required durable classification record with a missing gate field.

Artifact evidence: the target has the required semantic content but under a different key:

```yaml
weakest_missing_or_failed_gates:
  - id: JSG-04
  - id: JSG-06
  - id: JSG-07
```

Requirement or boundary: the commissioned checklist asks for schema fidelity, including the required `weakest_missing_or_failed_gate` field. The ladder schema is the controlling source for the field name. A case artifact may add explanatory detail, but it should not silently rename a required schema key unless a controlling source authorizes the schema extension.

Impact: the substantive gate analysis is directionally correct: JSG-04 and JSG-06 are not cleared, and JSG-07 is absent. The defect is structural. A schema-following consumer looking for the ladder-owned singular key can treat the classification as missing its weakest-gate field, which weakens downstream routing before JSG-07 scoring, fixture, or higher-tier work. This blocks a clean "schema fidelity" or acceptance recommendation for the current artifact.

Blocked state: no lane blocker. This is an artifact correctness finding. Strict acceptance/readiness/validation claims remain not proven.

Minimum closure condition: the classification record contains the exact ladder-owned `weakest_missing_or_failed_gate` key, or an accepted controlling source explicitly updates the schema to permit the plural field. If multiple blockers remain listed, the record should still make the weakest blocking gate machine-readable while preserving the explanatory JSG-04/JSG-06/JSG-07 list.

Next authorized action: CA/owner may authorize a narrow docs-only patch and bounded recheck. This review does not authorize the patch.

Red-green proof status: not_applicable for a non-executable artifact finding.

Strict claims that remain not proven: schema fidelity, acceptance, readiness, validation, scoring authorization, fixture admission, buyer proof, judgment-quality evidence, source-of-truth promotion.

Patch queue entry: not authorized in this lane.

### AR-02 - Minor - JSG-09/JSG-10 non-clearance is implied but not explicit in non-claims

Artifact role: Research artifact.

Location anchor: target title/role language at lines 1, 85, and 96; target YAML and prose non-claims at lines 201-217 and 277-289.

Source authority: `docs/product/judgment_spine_gate_ownership_map_v0.md` lines 146-150 states JSG-09 and JSG-10 are owned for classification and closeout recording only, and must not become completed judgment-quality evidence unless stronger gates and case-specific receipts are satisfied. The commission also requires preserving the non-claim that this review target is not JSG-09/JSG-10 clearance toward a stronger tier.

Artifact evidence: the target strongly caps the claim with `claim_cap: qualitative_case_learning_or_product_learning_context_only`, says not validation/readiness/buyer proof/judgment-quality/scoring/fixture/model execution, and says it does not promote any case artifact to a stronger tier. However, the non-claims do not explicitly say that the JSG-09/JSG-10 record itself is not JSG-09/JSG-10 clearance toward any stronger claim. The headings and purpose language repeatedly call the artifact a "JSG-09/JSG-10 Claim Classification and Closeout Record."

Requirement or boundary: because JSG-09/JSG-10 are the target gates, the artifact should distinguish "floor classification recorded" from "gate clearance toward stronger work" in the same non-claim surface that later operators will scan.

Impact: this is not a current overclaim by itself. A careful reader sees the qualitative-only cap and the stronger non-claims. The risk is downstream shortcutting: a future operator could treat the existence of a JSG-09/JSG-10 record as the relevant clearance token rather than as a floor-classification record. That is exactly the false-clearance leakage the commission asked this review to pressure.

Blocked state: no lane blocker. This is a minor boundary-hardening defect, secondary to AR-01.

Minimum closure condition: the target explicitly states, in the YAML `non_claims` or adjacent prose non-claims, that the artifact records floor classification only and is not JSG-09/JSG-10 clearance toward scoring, fixture admission, buyer-proof, or judgment-quality claims.

Next authorized action: include this in the same narrow docs-only patch if CA/owner authorizes one. This review does not authorize the patch.

Red-green proof status: not_applicable for a non-executable artifact finding.

Strict claims that remain not proven: JSG-09/JSG-10 clearance, scoring authorization, fixture admission, validation, readiness, buyer proof, judgment-quality evidence.

Patch queue entry: not authorized in this lane.

## Correctness Checks With No Finding

- Closeout state: `unreceipted_product_learning_context` is the correct weaker state under the current source pack. The JSG-08 receipt supplies durable qualitative material and a raw-answer handle, but the minimum product-learning receipt is incomplete and clean gate-bearing execution is not proven. `completed_product_learning_evidence` would overstate the floor; `no_durable_evidence` would understate the durable case material.
- Blocking gates: JSG-04, JSG-06, and JSG-07 are correctly named and source-backed. JSG-04/JSG-06 are not cleared; JSG-07 is not present.
- Claim cap: `qualitative_case_learning_or_product_learning_context_only` does not inflate the case into validation, readiness, scoring, fixture admission, buyer proof, or judgment-quality evidence.
- Provenance: the required target, JSG-08 receipt, JSG-08 recheck, case index, manifest, evidence ladder, and gate map hashes observed from disk match the cited or commissioned values. Provenance remains filesystem-anchored because the relevant case artifacts are untracked.
- Cross-file consistency: the target, JSG-08 receipt, case index, and manifest all preserve the qualitative-only cap and deny model run, score, score-ready fixture, validation, and judgment-quality proof.
- Retrieval/header honesty: the target declares `artifact_role: Research artifact`, `authority_boundary: retrieval_only`, clear `open_next`, input hashes, stale conditions, and a start-preflight with dirty/untracked notes.
- Completeness: the target is not truncated in the observed file state; 289 lines, balanced code fences, and expected terminal non-claims were observed.

## Phase 2 - Friction Findings

No separate friction finding. The only material process friction is downstream schema/routing ambiguity, already captured as AR-01 and AR-02 because it affects correctness and false-clearance control.

## Strict Claims That Remain Not Proven

- not validation
- not readiness
- not blind-use readiness
- not buyer proof
- not fixture admission
- not scoring authorization
- not model execution
- not model performance proof
- not completed product-learning evidence
- not completed judgment-quality evidence
- not JSG-04 gate clearance
- not JSG-06 gate clearance
- not JSG-07 scoring result
- not JSG-09/JSG-10 clearance toward a stronger tier
- not source-of-truth promotion
- not patch authority
- not mandatory remediation authority

## Minimum Closure Summary

| Finding | Minimum closure condition | Next authorized action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AR-01 | Exact ladder-owned `weakest_missing_or_failed_gate` key is present, or controlling schema explicitly permits the plural variant. | CA/owner patch authorization, then bounded recheck. |
| AR-02 | Non-claims explicitly state floor classification is not JSG-09/JSG-10 clearance toward stronger claims. | Same narrow patch if authorized. |

## Review-Use Boundary

These findings are decision input for the commissioning CA/owner. They are not approval, validation, gate clearance, mandatory remediation, source-of-truth promotion, or executor-ready patch authority. A separate authorized patch or acceptance lane must decide whether and how to change the target artifact.
