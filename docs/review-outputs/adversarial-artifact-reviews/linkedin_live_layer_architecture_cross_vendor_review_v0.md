# LinkedIn Live-Layer Architecture — Cross-Vendor Review + Adjudication (v0)

## Outcome
6 findings (1 critical, 4 major, 1 minor); **6/6 accepted** (F5 accepted-with-modification, 0 rejected). Two source-fact findings (F1, F3) independently verified against the code by the home model AND the recheck. Same-vendor recheck: **clean, no regressions.** Direction unchanged; claims + slice plan tightened.

## Findings + adjudication

| # | Sev | Finding (GPT-5.5) | Adjudication (CA) | Verification |
|---|-----|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| F1 | critical | Isolation overclaimed — core already has D5/POC live concepts | **ACCEPT** — reframe isolation to one-way-dep + no-new-widening; existing D5/`optional_poc_risk` = already-incurred coupling | Verified: `linkedin_lane/models.py:71-72,84,165,197` |
| F2 | major | "No black-letter ToS" + "Verified reachability" are overclaims vs the lane's Non-Claims | **ACCEPT** — downgrade to design constraint + informal owner assumption; legal/ToS UNVERIFIED, deferred hard gate; out-of-scope | Against authority Non-Claims |
| F3 | major | "Raw constructor unreachable" not achievable in plain Python | **ACCEPT** — reframe to checkable adapter-API invariant ("exports only return validated rows/dicts") | Verified: `test_linkedin_lane.py:51,73,96` construct directly |
| F4 | major | Read-time minimization deferred to 3c but the seam is 3b | **ACCEPT** — minimization boundary moves into the 3b observation contract; runtime tape-test stays 3c | Against authority Hard Stops |
| F5 | major | Slice 3a = premature new-package schema gravity, duplicates existing envelope | **ACCEPT-modify** — 3a = harden the EXISTING envelope validators (no new package); new-package decision deferred to scoping | Existing `RunEnvelope`/`NextRunEnvelope` carry mode/caps/stop/`execution_authorized=False` |
| F6 | minor | "Point at any signal" too broad | **ACCEPT** — "extract any authorized, named, minimized signal after schema review" | — |

## Same-vendor recheck (Sonnet)
All 6 `closed` with on-artifact evidence; F1/F3 source-facts re-confirmed; the 3a-harden-vs-no-new-fields consistency question resolves correctly (hardening validation on already-present fields ≠ widening); **revision regressions: none.** Verdict: clean.

## Post-review amendment (2026-06-10, assumption-gate)
F5's accepted form ("harden the existing envelope, no new package") was superseded at the pre-build assumption-gate: a source read showed the core envelopes lack `owner_presence_attested`/`entitlement_gate_bypass` fields, and isolation forbids adding them to the core. Slice-3a was re-scoped to a minimal **adapter contract record** (Opt 2 — attestation fields in the satellite). See ADR §8 (v0.1 amendment). This is the gate catching, via source, what the artifact-level review did not.

## Boundary
Advisory only. Not approval, validation, readiness, or mandatory remediation. The accepted architecture is `data_capture_spine_linkedin_live_layer_architecture_v0.md` (owner sign-off 2026-06-10); this record is its review provenance.
