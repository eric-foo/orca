# Contestant No-Tools Execution Contract Post-Patch Closure Check

## Scope

This is a bounded post-patch closure and blast-radius check for the three
findings in
`contestant_no_tools_execution_contract_external_adversarial_artifact_review_v0.md`.
It is not a new full adversarial review, not a probe execution, not a runtime
hook implementation, and not a fixture-readiness decision.

## Closure Result

Recommendation: `accept_closure`

All three external review findings are closed by the patch.

### AR-01 - `tool_call_trace_status: not_applicable` Scope Constraint

Status: `closed`

The contract now defines a tool trace classification rule. `not_applicable` is
valid only when the execution environment structurally cannot invoke tools
regardless of configuration, such as a raw API call where no tool schema or
retrieval channel is supplied.

The same rule states that Agent harnesses, browser harnesses, API wrappers, or
other paths where tools could theoretically be present must use `unavailable`
unless the receipt records concrete configuration evidence that no tool schema,
tool channel, browser tool, filesystem/workspace access, or external retrieval
surface was offered.

The protocol now points back to that structural rule and says execution paths
where traces could exist but were not captured must use `unavailable`, not
`not_applicable`.

Closure basis: the finding's scope ambiguity is removed without treating
absence of visible tool output as proof of no-tools isolation.

### AR-02 - Stale-Language Search Execution And Review-Prompt Coverage

Status: `closed`

The contract's direction-change propagation receipt now includes
`docs/research/judgment-spine/harness/v0_14/review_prompts/` in downstream
surfaces checked and in the stale-language search surface list.

The receipt now records the search result: harness-local review prompts were
included, the only review-prompt hit was
`opus_code_ready_sanity_review_prompt.md` naming "memorization probe protocol",
and no stale prompt-only pass, clean-pass bypass, or old
probe-result-pass-sufficient language was found there.

Closure basis: the previously specified-but-unconfirmed search is now
documented as executed, and the missing review-prompt surface is included.

### AR-03 - Claim-Boundary Wording Consistency

Status: `closed`

The memorization probe protocol now uses the same caveat as the no-tools
contract for fail results when isolation is not proven: the result must not be
cited as proof of training-data memorization specifically.

Closure basis: the contract and protocol now align on the conservative
gate-closing-but-not-causal-proof boundary.

## Blast-Radius Check

Touched surfaces checked:

- `contestant_no_tools_execution_contract_v0.md`
- `memorization_probe_protocol.md`
- `index.md`
- harness-local `review_prompts/`
- Daimler selected-family gate outcome decision caveat
- Daimler Claude Opus probe tool-isolation review caveat
- Orca repo map v0.14 routing row
- overlay validation-gates source-heavy economy gate

Observed blast-radius result: no critical or major regression found in the
touched scope.

Preserved constraints:

- Raw `probe_result: pass` is still not sufficient for clean gate clearing.
- Clean pass still requires `probe_result == pass` and
  `isolation_result == proven`.
- A fail result with unproven isolation may still close a gate conservatively,
  but must not be cited as proof of training-data memorization specifically.
- Tool use or non-empty tool traces still invalidate clean execution.
- Prompt-only "do not search" language is still explicitly insufficient.
- Agent-harness or wrapper paths with possible but uncaptured tool traces now
  route to `unavailable`, not `not_applicable`.
- The Daimler Claude Opus result remains gate-closing with caveat; it is not
  rescued into blind-use readiness and not promoted into memorization proof.
- No project-wide overlay gate was changed; the change remains harness-v0.14
  local.
- The v0.14 index still only routes to the contract and does not authorize
  execution, probe runs, scoring, validation, fixture admission, or judgment
  claims.

## Residual Friction

- This patch is docs-only. It does not create a runtime hook that disables
  tools or captures a tool-call trace.
- Future operators still need a concrete no-tools execution path and receipt
  evidence before a clean gate can pass.
- Historical Daimler review and decision artifacts still contain the gate label
  `failed_memorization_probe`; the selected-family decision carries the caveat
  that this is a conservative routing label, not verified causal proof.

## Non-Claims

- No probe was run.
- No probe pass is claimed.
- No target contestant was exposed to participant packet material.
- No blind-use authorization is claimed.
- No model judgment run was performed.
- No scoring was performed.
- No ledger freeze was performed.
- No schema or runtime implementation was performed.
- No validation, fixture admission, product proof, or judgment-quality proof is
  claimed.

plumbing works only; not judgment quality.
