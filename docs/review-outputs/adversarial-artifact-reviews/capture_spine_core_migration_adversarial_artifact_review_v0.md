  summary: >
    The migration is complete and correct: all 103 current Capture spine files
    moved 1:1 under capture/core/ (verified against the real commit, not only the
    normalized packet), destinations are right, live routing surfaces are
    repointed, the DCP receipt is honest and its central stale-path claim
    reproduces, no scope creep / empty future dirs / authority leak / checker
    weakening / whitespace defects were found. Three minor disclosure-and-
    completeness frictions remain, none blocking merge.
```

## Method And Readiness

- Method skills REFERENCE-LOADED then APPLIED in order: `workflow-deep-thinking`
  (boundary framing, failure-mode and anti-anchoring discipline) and
  `workflow-adversarial-artifact-review` (two-phase correctness-then-friction
  flow, source-read-only boundary, finding schema).
- Deep-thinking discipline status: applied. Verification pass actively tried to
  defeat the "clean migration" reading by re-running the receipt's own searches
  against the byte-exact commit and by hunting short-form path residuals the
  receipt regex cannot catch. That pass converted an initial "plan born stale"
  alarm into a correctly-scoped minor (the binding DCP receipt discloses it) and
  surfaced AR-02.
- `SOURCE_CONTEXT_READY`: declared after the source-context gate passed.
- Source-context gate (prompt requirement): all five packet hashes recomputed and
  matched the prompt header exactly (`diff_u80.patch`, `name_status.tsv`,
  `refs.txt`, `head_snapshot_files.txt`, `base_snapshot_files.txt`). Target
  commit and merge-base both present. Not `BLOCKED_SOURCE_CONTEXT`; not
  `BLOCKED_REPO_ACCESS_UNAVAILABLE`.
- Trigger gate: explicit `workflow-adversarial-artifact-review` lane requested by
  the filed prompt. Pass.
- Lane-collision: this is a non-code artifact migration (docs/markdown +
  retrieval metadata + one hook self-test fixture line). Implementation/runtime
  behavior is out of lane and excluded by the prompt. No undeclared collision.
- Output binding: `filesystem-output` with bound `required_output_path` (this
  file). Read-only on all reviewed source; the report is the only write.

## Source-Read Ledger

Evidence was taken from the pinned packet **and** from the byte-exact Git objects
at the merge-base and target commit (`git ls-tree` / `git grep` / `git diff` at
`35066b15` and `a75c337b`), because the packet snapshots are whitespace-
normalized. Where a claim is load-bearing, it was confirmed against the real
commit, not only the snapshot.

| Source | Why read | Decision it supports | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| packet `manifest/name_status.tsv`, `refs.txt`, README | Enumerate the 226-row change set (A=1, M=122, R=103) and confirm packet integrity | Move map; gate pass | clean; hashes matched |
| `git ls-tree a75c337b / 35066b15 -- .../capture/**` | Byte-exact move completeness | Q1 (103→103, none outside core) | clean (committed) |
| head_files / base_files snapshots | Old vs new full-file context; rename semantic check | Q1–Q3 | normalized (disclosed) |
| `capture_spine_core_source_family_migration_plan_v0.md` (added) | Keystone plan artifact; future-reserved discipline | Q8, Q12, AR-03 | in-tree at HEAD; `stale_if` fired |
| `orca_spine_first_target_structure_binding_v0.md` (amended) | Amendment accuracy + DCP receipt | Q6, Q7, AR-01 | amended in-range |
| `git grep` receipt regex @ a75c337b | Reproduce DCP `stale_language_search` claim | Q5, Q7 | verified |
| `git grep` short-form old paths @ a75c337b | Catch residuals the receipt regex cannot | Q5, AR-02 | residuals found |
| `git diff` of `check_map_links.py` | Checker weakening / fixture correctness | Q10 | clean |
| `git diff` of `safety-rules.md`, `source-loading.md` | Authority-leak check | Q9 | clean |
| `data_capture_spine_consolidation_map_v0.md`, `orca_repo_map_v0.md` @ a75c337b | Routing usefulness post-move | Q4, Q11 | clean |
| `moved_paths_index.md`, `moves_manifest.csv` @ a75c337b | Moved-path index updated | Q4 | clean |
| `git diff --check 35066b15..a75c337b` | Whitespace/CRLF | Q13 | clean |

Dirty/untracked notes: the review-target commit `a75c337b` is **not** the branch
tip; the branch HEAD (`8df13cbd`) adds the review prompt + packet. Per the prompt,
those review-package files are excluded from the change under review and were not
treated as migration content. The codex worktree tree was clean at review time.
The reviewer operated from a separate `.claude` worktree but read and wrote only
the codex workspace named by the prompt.

## Review Boundary And Excluded Scope

- In scope: moved-path correctness, reference repointing on live surfaces, DCP /
  binding honesty, scope containment, hook-fixture and overlay-authority
  integrity, retrieval-metadata and whitespace hygiene — for the pinned commit.
- Excluded (per prompt): runtime/harness behavior, source-access implementation,
  browser/scraping/scanning design, the owner accept/merge decision, patch
  execution, broad `docs/review-outputs/`, broad `docs/prompts/`, `docs/research/`,
  `docs/_inbox/`, external web research, and the later review-package commit.

## Decision Criteria

- **Move completeness/correctness (critical class):** every current Capture file
  re-homed under `capture/core/`, no loss, no duplicate destination, no accidental
  non-Capture move, no hidden semantic change inside renames.
- **Live-routing integrity (critical/major class):** no live map/overlay/product/
  harness/open_next surface routes agents to a retired path; the hook is not
  weakened; overlays grant no new authority.
- **Honesty (major class):** the binding amendment and DCP receipt accurately
  describe what changed, what did not, and what is deferred; no validation/
  readiness/merge overclaim.
- **Containment (major class):** no empty future dirs, no false satellite/Search/
  TikTok/YouTube/source-quality/cadence claims, no scope creep.
- **Friction/disclosure (minor class):** stated conventions match the executed
  tree; residual old-path mentions are either disclosed-historical or cleaned.

## Findings (correctness first, then friction)

All three findings are `minor`. No `critical` or `major` finding was found.

### AR-01 — Re-asserted "must carry a README" convention is unmet and undisclosed

- **finding id:** AR-01
- **severity:** minor
- **phase:** correctness
- **commissioned target/purpose:** PR #316 Capture spine core migration; semantic
  preservation of source families (Q2) and convention-vs-tree consistency (Q6).
- **artifact role:** accepted target-structure binding (authority) + executed tree.
- **location / search key:** `docs/decisions/orca_spine_first_target_structure_binding_v0.md`
  Convention 1 ("Each populated `source_families/<family>/` or
  `source_families/social_media/<platform>/` directory **must carry a README that
  cross-points to its phase sibling**"); executed dirs
  `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_families/retail_pdp/` and
  `.../social_media/instagram/`.
- **source evidence:** `git ls-tree a75c337b` of both family dirs returns only
  content files (6 retail_pdp `*.md`; 15 instagram `ig_*`/`orca_creator_*`); no
  README exists anywhere under `core/source_families/`. The convention text is
  pre-existing and was **extended** by this migration to cover
  `social_media/<platform>/` (diff line `+...social_media/<platform>/ directory
  must carry a README...`).
- **strongest defense, and why it only partly holds:** (a) the convention
  pre-existed and was already unmet, so the migration did not introduce the
  violation; (b) `scanning/source_families/instagram/` — the phase sibling the
  instagram README would cross-point to — does not exist at the target, so the
  cross-pointer is not yet actionable; (c) the plan is explicitly move-only with
  index creation deferred. The defense holds enough to keep this minor, but does
  not fully close it: the migration **re-asserted and broadened** a "must" rule in
  the same commit while leaving it unmet, and neither the plan's deferred queue
  nor the DCP receipt's `intentionally_not_updated` lists the missing source-family
  READMEs (it lists the plan, the inventory, and the empty future placeholder
  folders, but not this).
- **impact:** low routing risk; affects directory-level self-documentation of the
  scanning-vs-capture phase separation and leaves a stated convention readable as
  satisfied when it is not. Distorts future Capture work only mildly and only if
  carried silently.
- **minimum_closure_condition:** either (i) add the cross-pointer READMEs to the
  populated families, or (ii) record the README convention as an explicit deferral
  in the DCP receipt `intentionally_not_updated` / plan deferred queue with the
  "phase sibling not yet created" rationale.
- **next_authorized_action:** report only; this lane cannot edit the binding or
  create READMEs.
- **patch_queue_entry:** not authorized (read-only review); advisory only.
- **red-green proof:** not_applicable (non-executable artifact convention).
- **not proven:** whether Orca intends the README rule to bind at this wave or only
  when both phase siblings are populated — that is an owner/authority call.

### AR-02 — Short-form old-path residuals survive in actively-repointed migration docs

- **finding id:** AR-02
- **severity:** minor
- **phase:** correctness
- **commissioned target/purpose:** reference repointing completeness (Q4, Q5) and
  DCP search thoroughness (Q7).
- **artifact role:** migration/proposal records (historical), touched by this commit.
- **location / search key:**
  `docs/migration/orca_second_pass_consolidation_plan_v0.md:96`
  (`...IG docs at \`capture/source_families/instagram/\``, B6 CLOSED row) and
  `docs/migration/phase2_proposals/capture_toolbox_families_w3a_proposal_v0.md:8,109`
  (`...capture/source_families/ (21 files...)`; finding header "SubNiche used as
  ontology-shaped term in source_families/instagram/").
- **source evidence:** `git diff 35066b15..a75c337b` shows both docs were
  **actively repointed** on many lines (`capture/...` → `capture/core/...`,
  including `source_families/instagram/...` → `core/source_families/social_media/
  instagram/...`), yet these short-form mentions were left old. They are invisible
  to the DCP receipt's verification because its `stale_language_search` regex
  requires the fully-qualified `orca/product/spines/capture/` prefix; a `git grep`
  for short-form `capture/(...subdir...)/` at the target surfaces them.
- **strongest defense, and why it only partly holds:** both lines are point-in-time
  historical content (a CLOSED status row; a prior-finding header), so they are
  arguably "intentionally historical." But unlike the two docs the receipt *does*
  disclose, these were partially rewritten in the same pass — neighboring lines in
  the *same files* were updated to `core/`. That makes the residual an inconsistent
  repoint, not a deliberate historical preservation, and it is undisclosed.
- **impact:** low — a reader of these migration records could be pointed at a
  retired short-form path, but no live map/overlay/product/harness/open_next surface
  is affected (confirmed: the receipt's fully-qualified search returns only the two
  disclosed docs).
- **minimum_closure_condition:** either finish the repoint on lines 96 / 8 / 109,
  or broaden the DCP `stale_language_search` to short-form `capture/<subdir>/` and
  record these as intentionally-historical.
- **next_authorized_action:** report only.
- **patch_queue_entry:** not authorized; advisory only.
- **red-green proof:** the broadened `git grep -nE "capture/(contracts|operating_model|packet_schema|demand_durability_indicators|source_capture_toolbox|source_families)/" | grep -v capture/core/`
  at the target is the natural check — it currently lists these residuals and would
  go quiet (for non-historical docs) after a fix.
- **not proven:** whether the migration author intends these specific lines to be
  frozen historical text; if so, the fix is disclosure, not rewrite.

### AR-03 — Added migration-plan doc presents as plan-only at a HEAD where the move is executed

- **finding id:** AR-03
- **severity:** minor
- **phase:** friction
- **commissioned target/purpose:** DCP/plan honesty and merge-readiness signalling
  (Q6, Q12, Q14).
- **artifact role:** Orca migration plan (docs-only), added in this range.
- **location / search key:**
  `docs/migration/capture_spine_core_source_family_migration_plan_v0.md` header
  (`branch_or_commit: ... @ 35066b15`, `Status: MIGRATION_PLAN_ONLY`,
  `stale_if: Any file under orca/product/spines/capture/ is moved...`) and body
  ("No execution is authorized here"; "proposed future paths ... not current
  accepted placement").
- **source evidence:** the plan is added by commits `9c3d5871`/`3c110745`/`0550790d`;
  the moves execute in the final commit `a75c337b` — all inside the reviewed range.
  At the reviewed HEAD the plan sits in-tree unchanged while the tree shows the
  move done, so its own `stale_if` has already fired and its header still points at
  the pre-move base.
- **strongest defense, and why it largely holds:** the binding amendment's DCP
  receipt explicitly lists this plan under `intentionally_not_updated` with the
  rationale "Retains the pre-execution planning table and old-path evidence; the
  follow-on execution state is recorded by this receipt and the git rename diff,"
  and the fired `stale_if` is Orca's sanctioned staleness signal. So a reader who
  follows the controlling source is not misled. The defense holds enough to keep
  this a friction-class minor rather than a correctness defect; the residual is only
  that the plan **read in isolation** still says "no execution authorized" with no
  forward pointer to the executed state.
- **impact:** low — confined to a cold read of the plan alone; the controlling
  binding and the git history both carry the executed truth.
- **minimum_closure_condition:** optional one-line "EXECUTED 2026-06-21 — see the
  binding amendment DCP receipt and the git rename diff" note (or an `executed_by`
  field) in the plan; otherwise explicitly accept that `stale_if` + DCP disclosure
  is the intended signal.
- **next_authorized_action:** report only.
- **patch_queue_entry:** not authorized; advisory only.
- **red-green proof:** not_applicable (provenance-language finding).
- **not proven:** nothing material; this is disclosed by design and flagged only
  for completeness.

---

## Non-Findings That Matter (verified clean)

- **Move completeness (Q1) — verified against the real commit.** `git ls-tree`
  at `a75c337b` returns **zero** Capture files outside `core/`; base 103 → target
  103 under `core/` (1:1), no pre-existing `core/`, no loose root files. Counts by
  old subdir (contracts 8, demand_durability_indicators 8, operating_model 35,
  packet_schema 3, source_capture_toolbox 28, source_families 21) reconcile exactly.
- **Instagram (Q2) and Retail/PDP (Q3).** Instagram moved
  `source_families/instagram/` → `core/source_families/social_media/instagram/`
  (15 files); Retail/PDP stayed a capture source family at
  `core/source_families/retail_pdp/` (6 files), not a satellite or contract layer.
- **Rename semantic integrity (Q1).** The lowest-similarity rename (R072,
  `capture_recon_index_v0.md`, ~28% changed) is, after filtering path-repoint lines,
  a **pure path repoint** — no hidden semantic change. Low similarity indices reflect
  dense in-file path references, not content drift.
- **Live-surface repointing (Q4, Q5, Q11).** The consolidation map and repo map
  route entirely through `capture/core/` (repo map names `core/` and
  `social_media/instagram` explicitly); `moved_paths_index.md` and
  `moves_manifest.csv` (105 `core/` rows) record the moves; source-loading and
  safety-rules read packs are repointed. The receipt's own
  `stale_language_search` reproduced at the target returns **only** the two
  disclosed historical docs (8 plan + 3 inventory) — no live map/overlay/product/
  harness/open_next surface retains a fully-qualified old path.
- **DCP receipt honesty (Q7).** `controlling_sources_updated` (5),
  `downstream_surfaces_checked` (10), `intentionally_not_updated` (plan, inventory,
  future placeholder folders), and the `stale_language_search_result` are accurate
  for the surfaces they scope; the central "no live surface retained old paths"
  claim was independently reproduced.
- **Binding amendment accuracy (Q6).** The 2026-06-21 amendment correctly states
  103 files re-homed, Retail/PDP and Instagram destinations, and disclaims satellite/
  Search/TikTok/YouTube/source-quality/cadence/harness/source-access. The accepted
  target tree marks future-reserved families "no current Capture files."
- **Containment / no false futures (Q8).** Only one file was added (the plan);
  `git ls-tree` shows **no** empty placeholder dirs or `.gitkeep` for
  tiktok/youtube/web_search_capture/source_quality/cadence. `source_quality_*`
  files correctly stayed under `core/source_capture_toolbox/` (extraction deferred),
  matching the plan's "deliberate second wave."
- **Authority preservation (Q9).** `safety-rules.md` and `source-loading.md` diffs
  are pure path repoints; authority language and `non_claims` (e.g. "not new capture
  authorization") are byte-identical. No new capture/browser/scraping/source-access/
  runtime/validation/readiness authority.
- **Hook integrity (Q10).** `check_map_links.py` changed exactly one `selftest()`
  fixture string (`capture/operating_model` → `capture/core/operating_model`); the
  ancestor-coverage assertion stays `True` and the link-validation logic is
  untouched. Not weakened.
- **Overclaim (Q12).** Plan and binding carry explicit non-claims; commit message
  ("docs: migrate capture spine under core") is modest and accurate. No validation/
  readiness/source-of-truth/merge-readiness overclaim.
- **Hygiene (Q13).** `git diff --check 35066b15..a75c337b` is clean — no whitespace/
  CRLF/path-separator defects in the committed change.

## Not-Proven Boundaries

- **Out-of-scope pre-existing residuals.** Unmodified records still reference old
  capture paths at the target —
  `docs/decisions/orca_search_product_lane_binding_v0.md:55`
  (`capture/demand_durability_indicators/search_interest/`, a moved path),
  `docs/decisions/orca_spine_first_blocker_authorization_v0.md:49,75`,
  `docs/migration/spine_first_target_move_table_v0.md`,
  `docs/migration/spine_first_untagged_file_inventory_v0.md`. These were not touched
  by this migration; the plan explicitly defers non-Capture-surface reference
  updates to a future pass, and the search-lane binding is already a recorded
  spine-first deferral. Whether any of these should ride this PR is an owner-scope
  call, not a defect introduced here. Not proven that leaving them is wrong.
- **Convention-binding timing (AR-01).** Not proven whether the README rule binds at
  this wave.
- **Byte-exact body content** was confirmed via Git objects where load-bearing; the
  packet snapshots are whitespace-normalized and were not used as the basis for any
  whitespace/encoding claim.

## Final Recommendation

```text
accept_with_friction
```

The migration is complete, correct, honestly receipted, and contained; no finding
blocks merge. The three minor frictions (AR-01 README-convention disclosure, AR-02
short-form residuals, AR-03 plan executed-signal) are carryable and can be closed in
a small optional follow-up or explicitly accepted as disclosed. Answer to Q14: the
migration does **not require** a targeted patch to be safe to take PR #316 out of
draft; a minor DCP-completeness patch is advisable but optional.

## Review-Use Boundary

These findings are decision input for the owner, not mandatory remediation. This
read-only lane did not patch the migration, the binding, the plan, the hook, or any
source; it made no owner accept/merge decision and authorized no source-access,
runtime, validation, or readiness. Owner acceptance, any patch, and any
implementation work require separate explicit authorization.
