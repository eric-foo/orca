  - Checking why the remaining missing-header backlog was accepted as residual.
  - Reviewing the Milwaukee authority-boundary patch adjudication.

## Review Provenance

- review_type: delegated adversarial artifact review plus home-model adjudication
- reviewed_by: gpt-5-codex-inherited-subagent
- authored_by: gpt-5-codex-home-model
- de_correlation_bar: same_vendor_sanity
- same_vendor_rationale: Bounded documentation/header hardening review using an in-session inherited subagent from the same GPT-5/Codex family; no cross-vendor discovery or no-new-seam claim is made.
- model_identity_note: Exact runtime build/version was not exposed by the subagent/tooling surface; these fields record the known GPT-5/Codex family-level identity rather than inventing finer precision.
- delegated_reviewer: in-session subagent `019f1f72-0f1c-7042-8dc1-3d03a19c9f82`

## Findings

### AR-MEGA-01 - Accepted And Patched

phase: correctness / authority hygiene

location evidence:

- `docs/workflows/repo_map_retrieval_batches_3_5_v0.md` originally said the Milwaukee body remained non-authoritative after changing its header authority boundary.
- `docs/decisions/consultant_loop/milwaukee_initial_judgement.md` originally had seal and non-claim language, but did not explicitly say the artifact was not Orca decision/source authority after the header was normalized to `authority_boundary: retrieval_only`.

strongest defense:

- `retrieval_only` is the controlled header value, and `.agents/workflow-overlay/retrieval-metadata.md` says that header value does not create or upgrade authority.

why the defense failed:

- The schema change was correct, but the Batch record's preservation claim was stronger than the Milwaukee body text. Moving the non-authority boundary out of the header required the body to carry that boundary explicitly.

impact:

- Low but real false-authority risk: future readers could treat a sealed companion note under `docs/decisions/consultant_loop/` as more authoritative than intended.

minimum_closure_condition:

- Milwaukee's body explicitly states the note is a sealed comparison artifact only and not Orca decision authority, source-of-truth authority, validation evidence, readiness evidence, or outcome calibration.

adjudication:

- Accepted.
- Patched `docs/decisions/consultant_loop/milwaukee_initial_judgement.md` to add the explicit authority-boundary sentence in the body.
- Patched `docs/workflows/repo_map_retrieval_batches_3_5_v0.md` to say the body now carries the explicit non-authority boundary instead of relying on an unsupported preservation claim.

next_authorized_action:

- Re-run retrieval/header/link gates after staging so the new review report is included in changed-file checks.

patch_queue_entry authorized:

- No. This review is decision input and home-model adjudication, not an executor-ready patch queue.


## Returned Delegated Recheck Adjudication

A second delegated read-only adversarial review return was couriered back after this report was first written. Its finding IDs are namespaced here as `AR-MEGA-RR-*` to avoid colliding with the original `AR-MEGA-01` finding above.

### AR-MEGA-RR-01 - Accepted And Patched

phase: correctness / source-fidelity

finding:

- The Batch 3-5 record paraphrased the generated-output exclusion as ending when future Orca work authorizes generated artifacts. The overlay's rule is narrower: generated outputs are excluded, and the retrieval-header contract applies if an excluded file is later promoted into a durable Orca artifact role.

adjudication:

- Accepted.
- Patched `docs/workflows/repo_map_retrieval_batches_3_5_v0.md` to state that mere authorization to exist as a generated output is not a retrieval-header trigger; promotion into a durable Orca artifact role is the trigger.

minimum_closure_condition:

- The batch record matches `.agents/workflow-overlay/retrieval-metadata.md` on generated-output exclusion and promotion-time header application.

### AR-MEGA-RR-02 - Accepted And Patched

phase: friction / provenance measurement

finding:

- The report recorded `reviewed_by: unrecorded` and `authored_by: unrecorded` while also recording `de_correlation_bar: same_vendor_sanity`; this left the same-vendor measurement weak even though the in-session subagent and home model family were knowable at the family level.

adjudication:

- Accepted with precision limit.
- Patched the provenance block to record `gpt-5-codex-inherited-subagent` and `gpt-5-codex-home-model`, plus a note that exact runtime build/version was not exposed by tooling.
- The report still makes no cross-vendor discovery or no-new-seam claim.

minimum_closure_condition:

- The durable record carries the known family-level reviewer/author identity and does not fabricate narrower build precision.

### AR-MEGA-RR-03 - Accepted And Patched

phase: friction / authorization trace

finding:

- The Batch 3-5 record required future off-touch sweeps to have a separate authorizing proof slice but did not name the commission under which this batch's own targeted off-touch slice ran.

adjudication:

- Accepted.
- Patched `docs/workflows/repo_map_retrieval_batches_3_5_v0.md` to name the owner instruction in the repo-map PR lane for Batch 3, Batch 4, Batch 5, then one mega adversarial delegated review.
- The trace is recorded as the durable context for this batch only; it is not independent authorization for future sweeps.

minimum_closure_condition:

- The batch record names the current batch commission and does not allow future records to treat this retrieval-only record as standing authorization.

## Operator Closeout Source

- returned_review_source: attached delegated read-only adversarial artifact review return in the home thread
- accepted_findings: `AR-MEGA-RR-01`, `AR-MEGA-RR-02`, `AR-MEGA-RR-03`
- rejected_findings: none
- modified_findings: `AR-MEGA-RR-02` accepted with a precision limit: family-level GPT-5/Codex identity is recorded; exact runtime build/version remains not exposed by tooling
- kept_changes: generated-output wording corrected; batch commission trace added; review provenance made measurable at known family level
- validation_gap: no cross-vendor discovery review was run; no no-new-seam claim is made
- remaining_risk: 61 historical missing headers remain accepted advisory backlog under the on-touch policy
## Non-Findings

- The targeted headers do not violate the no-broad-backfill rule: Batch 3 touched a small set of foundational workflow, migration, review-input, and decision-boundary artifacts rather than sweeping historical prompts/review outputs.
- Leaving 61 missing headers is an accepted residual under the current architecture: `--health` reports advisory backlog, while `--strict` gates changed durable docs forward-only.
- Batch 4 correctly found no recent-change notes to promote; the satellite contains only `README.md`.
- Batch 5 correctly avoided a standing gardener or broad stricter gate; the evidence showed one concrete Windows encoding defect, already patched in Batch 2, not repeated stale-note or missed-promotion failures.
- No changed-file retrieval header schema, generated index, or map-link defect was found in the reviewed set.

## Strict Boundaries And Not-Proven Claims

- Not validation, readiness, approval, repo-map completeness, source-of-truth promotion, or proof that all historical docs are retrievable.
- Not a cross-vendor discovery review and not a no-new-seam claim.
- Review findings are decision input only; remediation becomes mandatory only if separately accepted or bound by an authorized lane.
- A green retrieval/header/link check is routing hygiene only.
