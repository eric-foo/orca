## Source Preflight

### Bindings

- **Review lane**: adversarial artifact review per `.agents/workflow-overlay/review-lanes.md`
- **Artifact roles**: product artifact (new, untracked) + Orca overlay authority (modified, co-patched)
- **Output mode**: filesystem-output
- **Required output path**: `docs/review-outputs/adversarial-artifact-reviews/judgment_spine_closeout_state_ladder_patch_adversarial_artifact_review_v0.md`
- **Output collision confirmed**: path was non-existing at time of write
- **Edit permission**: read-only review; no artifact edits authorized in this lane
- **Dirty-state allowance**: broader worktree is dirty; review scoped to the two named target files only; unrelated dirty files are not reviewed
- **Source hierarchy**: Orca overlay wins for Orca project facts per `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md`
- **Severity contract**: `critical` / `major` / `minor` per review prompt; severity is finding priority, not approval or mandatory remediation
- **Recommendation vocabulary**: `accept_as_control_improvement` / `patch_minor_then_use` / `patch_required_before_reuse` / `blocked_source_conflict`

### Source-Read Ledger

| Source | Why read | Key decision supported | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Overlay authority entrypoint, required source | Agent behavior kernel; Orca instructions; doctrine-change propagation requirement | clean (tracked, unmodified at review) |
| `.agents/workflow-overlay/README.md` | Overlay entrypoint | Overlay binding rule and section index | modified (dirty) |
| `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md` | Source hierarchy and propagation contract | Doctrine-change trigger vocabulary; receipt shape; known source documents list | modified (dirty) |
| `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md` | Source-loading budgets and read packs | Judgment Spine Evidence Ladder Read Pack; buyer-proof source-loading route | modified (dirty) |
| `.agents/workflow-overlay/review-lanes.md` | Review lane authority | Adversarial artifact review lane binding; reviewer permissions; patch-queue exclusion | modified (dirty) |
| `.agents/workflow-overlay/validation-gates.md` | Validation gate authority (review target) | Judgment Spine claim-tier gate wording after patch; closeout_state requirement | modified (dirty, co-patched) |
| `docs/product/judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md` | Primary review target | closeout_state vocabulary; matrix; weakest-cleared-gate rule; propagation receipt; Daimler boundary | untracked (new) |
| `docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md` | Navigation check — targeted sections | Judgment Spine claim-tier routing entries; navigation references to this ladder | modified (dirty) — targeted section only |
| `.agents/workflow-overlay/product-proof.md` | Downstream consumer gap check | Buyer-proof semantics; closeout_state alignment search | modified (dirty) — targeted search only |

**Dirty-source note**: All overlay files are modified. The two review targets (`judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md` = untracked; `validation-gates.md` = modified/co-patched) are explicitly allowed by the dirty-state allowance in the review prompt. Advisory findings proceed from repo-visible evidence with source gaps named. Strict claims about acceptance, source-of-truth promotion, validation, readiness, or proof remain blocked under the control-plane source-state gate.

**Source gaps noted**: `.agents/workflow-overlay/product-proof.md` was searched for closeout_state vocabulary only (no full read). Full read was not conducted; the targeted search result (no matches on `closeout_state`, `no_durable_evidence`, or `weakest-cleared-gate`) is sufficient to confirm the alignment gap for F-01.

---

## Trigger Gate

Explicit adversarial artifact review invocation via the review prompt. Trigger satisfied. No lane collision — both targets are non-code product and overlay documents. No implementation review content is present in scope.

---

## Artifact Role Preflight

- `docs/product/judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md`: role = Product artifact; `authority_boundary: retrieval_only`. **Untracked** — not yet committed to the repository. Advisory findings are authorized. Strict claims about acceptance, source-of-truth promotion, or validation remain `not proven` until committed and accepted by the owner.
- `.agents/workflow-overlay/validation-gates.md`: role = Orca overlay authority; `authority_boundary: retrieval_only`. **Modified** (co-patched in same bundle). Same advisory-only constraint applies for strict claims.

---

## Required Checks

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Target file hashes vs. expected | Both match expected values exactly |
| `closeout_state` search in both targets | 47 occurrences in architecture file; present in validation-gate patch text |
| `no_durable_evidence` search | Present in architecture file (closeout states section and matrix) |
| `weakest-cleared-gate` search | Present in architecture file (promotion rules) and validation-gate patch |
| `judgment-quality` search | Present in both target files |
| Stale `observed GPT-5.4 answer` language | None found; all references are non-claims or propagation receipt language |
| `judgment_quality_promotion_operating_model_v0.md` created | Confirmed not created |
| `git diff --check` on `validation-gates.md` | Clean (LF/CRLF warning only, exit 0) |
| Output path collision check | Path does not exist; clear to write |

## Phase 1: Correctness Findings

### F-01

```yaml
finding_id: F-01
severity: major
title: >
  product-proof.md is a declared downstream_consumer but is absent from the
  direction_change_propagation receipt — creates a buyer-proof source-loading bypass path
evidence: >
  The architecture file's retrieval header declares downstream_consumers including
  '.agents/workflow-overlay/product-proof.md'. The direction_change_propagation
  receipt names five downstream_surfaces_checked (AGENTS.md, overlay README,
  source-of-truth.md, source-loading.md, orca_repo_map_v0.md) and four
  intentionally_not_updated paths (source-loading.md, orca_repo_map_v0.md,
  judgment_quality_promotion_operating_model_v0.md, Daimler-specific artifacts).
  product-proof.md appears in neither list. A targeted search of product-proof.md
  confirms it contains no reference to closeout_state, no_durable_evidence,
  weakest-cleared-gate, or the weakest-cleared-gate rule. The source-loading read
  pack (source-loading.md, Judgment Spine Evidence Ladder Read Pack section) routes
  buyer-proof claims to 'open .agents/workflow-overlay/product-proof.md and
  docs/product/orca_buyer_proof_packet_v0.md' without requiring the architecture
  file to also be opened.
affected_file:
  - docs/product/judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md
line_or_section: >
  direction_change_propagation.downstream_surfaces_checked and
  direction_change_propagation.intentionally_not_updated sections;
  retrieval header downstream_consumers field
why_it_matters: >
  An agent following the buyer-proof source-loading path reads product-proof.md
  for buyer-proof guidance and encounters no pointer to the closeout_state
  classification requirement. The validation-gate patch requires classification,
  but validation-gates.md is not in the S0 default read pack and may not be
  loaded by agents using only the Judgment Spine Evidence Ladder Read Pack or a
  product-anchor S2 pack for buyer-proof work. The gap means the primary source
  for buyer-proof guidance does not carry any signal that closeout_state
  classification is now required before making buyer-proof claims. Agents could
  author buyer-proof artifacts without the classification step and only discover
  the requirement if they also read validation-gates.md. This is the most
  likely bypass path in the propagation receipt.
minimum_closure_condition: >
  product-proof.md is added to direction_change_propagation.downstream_surfaces_checked
  with documentation of whether alignment is needed, OR is added to
  intentionally_not_updated with an explicit reason why buyer-proof semantics
  do not require closeout_state alignment. One of these two entries must be
  present so the propagation receipt accounts for the declared downstream consumer
  and the omission is not silent.
next_authorized_action: >
  Owner decision on whether product-proof.md requires a patch to reference
  closeout_state, or whether the existing validation-gate route is sufficient
  to guide agents to the architecture file without a product-proof.md pointer.
  Propagation-receipt gap determination only; not patch execution authorization.
```

### F-02

```yaml
finding_id: F-02
severity: minor
title: Matrix fourth column readable as positive grant rather than cap ceiling
evidence: >
  Source-quality × execution-quality matrix (architecture file, "Source-Quality x
  Execution-Quality Matrix" section). Introductory prose states: "The matrix is
  a cap table for the evaluated claim, not a checklist that grants success."
  The fourth column header is "Strongest claim allowed." The third column is
  "Default closeout_state." Neither the column headers nor the row cells restate
  the cap-table framing or the "not a checklist" guard. The word "Strongest"
  combined with "allowed" positions the column as a positive authorization ceiling
  that has been earned once a row is matched. The cap-table guard exists only
  in the introductory prose, not at the table-scanning entry point.
affected_file: docs/product/judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md
line_or_section: >
  "Source-Quality x Execution-Quality Matrix" section — table header row,
  fourth column ("Strongest claim allowed")
why_it_matters: >
  A future agent using the matrix as a lookup without re-reading the intro prose
  could match their source-quality and execution-quality state to a row, read
  off the fourth column value, and treat it as meeting the promotion requirement.
  The column header "Strongest claim allowed" is the load-bearing phrase: it reads
  as a ceiling that has been achieved, rather than a cap that still requires the
  promotion receipt. The only guard against this misread is the introductory prose,
  which a table-scanning agent may not re-read.
minimum_closure_condition: >
  The cap-table framing or equivalent "not a grant" language appears at or within
  the matrix itself — via a column header note, table caption, or introductory
  sentence immediately before the table boundary — not only in the paragraph that
  precedes it.
next_authorized_action: >
  Advisory wording patch, owner-authorized. No patch execution authorized by this finding.
```

## Phase 2: Friction Findings

### F-03

```yaml
finding_id: F-03
severity: minor
title: >
  unreceipted_product_learning_context owner-note clause creates ambiguity
  between non-durable prior-thread memory and qualifying durable material
evidence: >
  closeout_state unreceipted_product_learning_context.use_when (architecture file,
  "Closeout States" section): "Some durable material exists for the evaluated
  product-learning surface, but the minimum product-learning receipt is incomplete
  or the material is limited to design, source-custody, owner-note, or
  unsealed-answer context." The sub-floor rule (Promotion Rules section) explicitly
  excludes "Specs, prompts, wrappers, runbooks, source capture receipts, or
  architecture documents" from filling a missing receipt, but does not explicitly
  name owner-stated prior-thread memory or non-durable written notes. The Daimler
  section describes owner-stated prior-thread advisory output as "candidate
  product-learning context" — which aligns with unreceipted_product_learning_context
  — but the boundary between a durable "owner-note" artifact and a non-durable
  prior-thread memory is not defined in either the use_when clause or the
  sub-floor rule.
affected_file: docs/product/judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md
line_or_section: >
  closeout_states.unreceipted_product_learning_context.use_when;
  Promotion Rules section, sub-floor rule paragraph
why_it_matters: >
  For cases where an owner-stated prior-thread answer exists but no durable
  artifact records a raw_answer_location, "owner-note context" in the use_when
  clause could support classification as unreceipted_product_learning_context
  (product-learning context only) rather than no_durable_evidence. Both states
  block buyer proof and judgment quality, so the impact on strongest-claim routing
  is low. The risk is that design work claims (product-narration questions, packet
  patch hypotheses, friction discovery) are permitted under a less stringent
  standard than the sub-floor rule intends. Whether prior-thread owner memory
  counts as "durable material" needs explicit statement.
minimum_closure_condition: >
  Either (a) the sub-floor rule is extended to explicitly address owner-stated
  prior-thread memory or non-written owner notes as insufficient to constitute
  "durable material," or (b) the use_when clause for unreceipted_product_learning_context
  clarifies that "owner-note" means a durably written artifact or file-linked record,
  not prior-thread conversation memory.
next_authorized_action: >
  Advisory clarification request to owner. No patch authorization granted.
```

### F-04

```yaml
finding_id: F-04
severity: minor
title: >
  input_hashes.validation-gates.md records pre-patch hash and branch_or_commit
  is stale relative to HEAD; no co-patch note explains the intentional mismatch
evidence: >
  Architecture file retrieval header: input_hashes.validation-gates.md value is
  B6870C667D67043C23BE234FCBF52523AE397D46E21BB1C01F89BA44DD51C2DD (pre-patch).
  Verified current validation-gates.md hash (post-patch): 8881313D3A014316CD2CE808825CDD0029EA42AFE51CC02A4BE894F10428EB29.
  branch_or_commit field: "main @ 829bbe0dc9545cc34f7174cd7f3058824f5fd331".
  Current HEAD: c939ba3. No note in the header explains that validation-gates.md
  was co-patched in the same bundle, making the hash mismatch intentional rather
  than drift. The stale_if conditions include "Judgment Spine closeout-state
  vocabulary is renamed, merged, split, or retired" but do not address co-patch
  hash relationships.
affected_file: docs/product/judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md
line_or_section: >
  Retrieval header — input_hashes.validation-gates.md field and
  branch_or_commit field (header block, lines approximately 19-35)
why_it_matters: >
  A future retrieval agent checking input_hashes against current file state will
  find validation-gates.md at a different hash and may flag the architecture file
  as stale or contaminated. The branch_or_commit mismatch (829bbe0 vs. c939ba3)
  compounds this. Neither discrepancy invalidates the doctrine, but both create
  false-stale signals that could reduce retrieval confidence and trigger unnecessary
  recheck work, since the file is untracked and the mismatch cannot be resolved
  by git log alone.
minimum_closure_condition: >
  Either (a) a co-patch note is added to the retrieval header explaining that
  validation-gates.md was patched in the same bundle and the input_hash records
  the pre-patch source state, or (b) input_hashes.validation-gates.md is updated
  to the post-patch hash and branch_or_commit is updated to HEAD when the
  architecture file is committed.
next_authorized_action: >
  Hygiene fix by the patch author at commit time, or a retrieval-header note
  added before the architecture file is relied on as a retrieval-anchored source.
  No patch authorization granted.
```

### F-05

```yaml
finding_id: F-05
severity: minor
title: >
  Artifact-level Non-Claims section uses buyer-pull vocabulary rather than
  buyer-proof tier vocabulary; tier-level non-claim is absent from the
  most-visible non-claims block
evidence: >
  Architecture file Non-Claims section: "This artifact does not prove buyer pull."
  The direction_change_propagation receipt non_claims block (same file, propagation
  receipt section) includes "not buyer proof." The artifact-level Non-Claims section
  does not include "This artifact does not constitute a completed buyer-proof receipt"
  or "This artifact is not buyer-proof evidence." Buyer pull (an observable behavior
  signal defined in .agents/workflow-overlay/product-proof.md) and buyer proof
  (an evidence tier defined in this architecture file's own Claim Tiers section)
  are distinct concepts in the Orca overlay.
affected_file: docs/product/judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md
line_or_section: "## Non-Claims" section
why_it_matters: >
  An agent reading only the Non-Claims section for explicit buyer-proof non-claims
  will find "buyer pull" but not "buyer proof" as an evidence tier. The more
  precise non-claim ("not buyer proof") exists in the propagation receipt but not
  in the artifact-level section. The gap is minor because the propagation receipt
  is authoritative, but the artifact-level Non-Claims section is the first place
  a reader would look for clear non-claims, and it is weaker than the receipt
  on this specific boundary.
minimum_closure_condition: >
  The artifact-level Non-Claims section is updated to include at least one of:
  "This artifact does not constitute a completed buyer-proof receipt" or
  "This artifact is not buyer-proof evidence" — using tier vocabulary, not
  behavior-signal vocabulary.
next_authorized_action: >
  Advisory wording patch, owner-authorized. No patch execution authorized.
```

### F-06

```yaml
finding_id: F-06
severity: minor
title: >
  closeout_state classification location is unspecified — external classification
  records could substitute without embedding classification in the classified artifact
evidence: >
  Architecture file, Closeout States opening paragraph: "closeout_state is required
  whenever a Judgment Spine artifact classifies proof, readiness, validation,
  fixture admission, scoring, blind use, or judgment-quality status." Validation-gate
  patch (validation-gates.md, Judgment Spine claim-tier gate): "artifacts must
  classify the claim tier and closeout state... before making proof, readiness,
  validation, fixture-admission, scoring, blind-use-readiness, or judgment-quality
  claims." Neither source specifies that the judgment_spine_claim_classification
  receipt must appear embedded in the classifying artifact itself, as opposed to
  in a separate external classification decision record. The "Required Receipts
  By Tier — Claim Classification Record" section provides the receipt shape but
  does not state where it must reside.
affected_file:
  - docs/product/judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md
  - .agents/workflow-overlay/validation-gates.md
line_or_section: >
  architecture: "Closeout States" section opening paragraph;
  validation-gates.md: "Judgment Spine claim-tier gate" entry
why_it_matters: >
  If the classification location is unspecified, a future agent could satisfy
  the requirement by producing a separate external classification record while
  the buyer-proof or judgment-quality artifact itself carries no embedded
  closeout_state classification. A reviewer reading only the artifact would not
  see the classification without also locating the external record. This weakens
  the recall surface for future agents performing artifact-level compliance checks.
  Impact is low for current claim-tier routing but creates process ambiguity
  over repeated artifact cycles.
minimum_closure_condition: >
  The architecture file or validation-gate clarifies whether the
  judgment_spine_claim_classification receipt must be embedded in the classified
  artifact or may reside in a separately co-referenced external decision record.
  If external records are permitted, a co-reference requirement should be stated.
next_authorized_action: >
  Advisory clarification. No patch authorization granted.
```

## Blast-Radius Assessment

A broader blast-radius check beyond the two target files is advisable **for `.agents/workflow-overlay/product-proof.md` only** (see F-01). The file is a declared `downstream_consumer` and the primary source for buyer-proof guidance; neither a check nor an intentional-skip reason is recorded in the propagation receipt. Whether it needs alignment requires an owner decision, not reviewer authority.

All other downstream surfaces are accounted for:

- `AGENTS.md`: checked in propagation receipt; no stale vocabulary found.
- `.agents/workflow-overlay/README.md`: checked; overlay entrypoint is not claim-routing.
- `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md`: checked; known source documents already lists this architecture file.
- `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md`: intentionally not updated (reason: existing read pack already routes to ladder).
- `docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md`: intentionally not updated (reason: existing navigation already points to ladder).
- `docs/product/judgment_quality_promotion_operating_model_v0.md`: intentionally deferred (confirmed not created).
- Daimler-specific run, prompt, source, and decision artifacts: intentionally not updated (reason: case-agnostic doctrine).

No other surfaces with stale closeout_state language were found in the targeted search scope.

## Adversarial Review Questions — Summary Dispositions

| Q# | Question | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Does closeout_state prevent partial evidence overpromtion? | Yes — vocabulary, sub-floor rule, and weakest-cleared-gate rule are collectively sound. F-03 notes a minor owner-note ambiguity that does not break the cap. |
| Q2 | Does the patch accidentally create a fourth tier? | No — explicit disclaimer present; closeout states are named as state records, not tiers; prose is clear. |
| Q3 | Are no_durable_evidence and unreceipted_product_learning_context distinct for Daimler? | Partially adequate — F-03 notes the owner-note/prior-thread ambiguity narrows the distinction between the two states for non-durable memory cases. |
| Q4 | Does the matrix act as a cap table or checklist? | Minor gap — F-02; "Strongest claim allowed" column reads as grant in the table; cap framing exists only in introductory prose. |
| Q5 | Does weakest-cleared-gate align between architecture and validation-gate? | Aligned — both say lowest cap, missing evidence is not a pass. |
| Q6 | Does validation-gate require naming closeout state before stronger claims? | Yes, reasonably clearly. F-06 notes that classification location is unspecified. |
| Q7 | Is direction_change_propagation adequate? | Partially adequate — product-proof.md omission is the major gap (F-01). All other surfaces are documented. |
| Q8 | Do stale metadata create a strict-claim blocker? | No strict-claim blocker — advisory hygiene issue only (F-04). |
| Q9 | Does the patch accidentally resolve any of the non-claim items? | No — non-claims are present. F-05 notes artifact-level non-claims use buyer-pull rather than buyer-proof tier vocabulary. |
| Q10 | Is broader blast-radius check needed? | Yes for product-proof.md specifically; no for other surfaces. |

## Review Recommendation

```yaml
review_recommendation: patch_minor_then_use
rationale: >
  The core doctrine is sound and safe to use as classification guidance. closeout_state
  vocabulary, the weakest-cleared-gate rule, the sub-floor cap, the matrix, and the
  validation-gate alignment are collectively adequate to prevent partial evidence from
  being overpromoted. No critical findings were identified. The single major finding
  (F-01) is a propagation-receipt structural gap, not a claim-safety defect: it does
  not create a false stronger claim. It creates a buyer-proof source-loading bypass
  path by omitting product-proof.md from the propagation receipt. This gap should be
  resolved — either by checking product-proof.md and documenting the result, or by
  adding an intentionally_not_updated entry with reason — before the architecture is
  cited as a complete propagation record for buyer-proof classification decisions.
  The four minor findings are wording, retrieval, and hygiene improvements that do
  not invalidate the patch.
```

## Non-Claims

This review does not claim:

- approval of this patch or any downstream artifact;
- validation of the Judgment Spine;
- readiness of any Judgment Spine artifact;
- buyer proof;
- product proof;
- fixture admission;
- scoring authorization;
- blind-use readiness;
- judgment-quality evidence;
- implementation authorization;
- Daimler claim-tier promotion;
- source-of-truth promotion beyond the reviewed artifacts.

## Review-Use Boundary

These findings are decision input for the owner. No finding authorizes a patch, edit, or implementation action by the reviewer. Accepting a finding, requesting a patch, and executing a patch are three separate authorized steps. The review recommendation `patch_minor_then_use` is decision input only — it is not approval, validation, mandatory remediation, or readiness.

Missing or deferred remediation does not block advisory use of the architecture for claim classification work. It qualifies that the product-proof.md propagation-receipt gap (F-01) should be resolved before the architecture is cited as a fully propagated doctrine change.

```yaml
next_authorized_action_summary:
  F-01: Owner decision on product-proof.md alignment or intentional-skip documentation.
  F-02: Advisory wording patch, owner-authorized.
  F-03: Advisory clarification on owner-note / durable-material boundary, owner-authorized.
  F-04: Hygiene fix at commit time or retrieval-header note before anchored reuse.
  F-05: Advisory wording patch, owner-authorized.
  F-06: Advisory clarification on classification location, owner-authorized.
