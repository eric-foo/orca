## Review Provenance

- `reviewed_by`: openai-gpt-5-codex.
- `authored_by`: `unrecorded`; the implementation author model/version was not supplied, and is not inferred from Git author or worktree naming.
- De-correlation measurement: not proven because `authored_by` is unrecorded.
- Requested output path: `docs/review-outputs/ep35_review_routing_disposition_gate_delegated_adversarial_code_review_v0.md`.
- Note: the requested path did not exist before this review. It was treated as the required durable review-output path, not as a source prompt.

**SOURCE_CONTEXT_READY**

## Validation Commands Run

| Command | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python .agents/hooks/check_review_routing.py --selftest` | PASS | `SELFTEST OK`; all listed pure-function cases passed. |
| `python .agents/hooks/check_review_routing.py --strict --base main` | PASS | `check_review_routing --strict: OK (base: main)`. |
| `python .agents/hooks/check_dcp_receipt.py --strict --base main` | PASS | `OK -- every real receipt in the changed .md files is shape-valid`. |
| `python .agents/hooks/header_index.py --strict --base main` | PASS | `OK -- 5 changed durable .md file(s) all have headers and are map-reachable`. |
| `python .agents/hooks/check_map_links.py --strict` | PASS | `OK (0 findings)` with 33 annotated nonresolving links as debt. |
| `python .agents/hooks/check_review_output_provenance.py --selftest` | PASS | `SELFTEST OK`. |
| `python -m pytest` from `orca-harness/` | FAILED / timed out at harness boundary after output | 2363 passed, 4 skipped, 2 failed, 1 warning in reported pytest output. Failures were `test_cli_requires_exactly_one_target` and `test_youtube_shorts_fragrance_creator_observation_ledger_live_lake_refs_when_available`; both are outside the EP-35 checker surface and appear tied to local `ORCA_DATA_ROOT` / live-lake environment behavior. |
| Direct function probe for rename-out path list | CONFIRMED BUG SHAPE | `evaluate(['docs/moved/gate_target.py'], [], ...)` returned `[]`; including the old code-root path returned the expected missing-disposition findings. |

## Findings

### FIND-01: Recognized renames out of a code root bypass the strict gate

- Review target: `.agents/hooks/check_review_routing.py`.
- Location: `diff_paths()` lines 200-207 and `run_commit_msg()` lines 266-272.
- Evidence:

```python
parts = ln.split("\t")
if len(parts) < 2:
    continue
status, path = parts[0].strip(), parts[-1].strip()
touched.append(path)
if status.startswith("A") or status.startswith("R") or status.startswith("C"):
    added.append(path)
```

For Git rename rows, `--name-status --find-renames` emits `Rnnn<TAB>old<TAB>new`. The checker keeps only `parts[-1]`, so a recognized rename such as `R100<TAB>orca-harness/gate_target.py<TAB>docs/moved/gate_target.py` contributes only `docs/moved/gate_target.py` to `touched`. That path is outside `CODE_ROOTS`, so `touches_code_root()` returns false and the change is silently out of scope.

The same parse pattern exists in `run_commit_msg()`, so the local advisory nudge misses the same staged rename shape.

- Impact: A branch can remove or relocate code out of `orca-harness/` or `.agents/hooks/` without adding a review artifact or commit-message disposition, and `--strict` can still pass. This is a false negative in the exact code-root-change detector EP-35 is meant to enforce.
- Minimum closure condition: For rename/copy rows, include both old and new paths in `touched`; for `added`, include only the destination path when the destination is added/copied/renamed into a review root. Add a selftest that simulates `R100\torca-harness/a.py\tdocs/a.py` and requires a missing-disposition finding.
- Next authorized action: Patch the checker and its selftests, then rerun `check_review_routing.py --selftest` and `check_review_routing.py --strict --base main`.
- Patch queue: not authorized by this review report.

### FIND-02: Strict CI can still fail open on internal checker exceptions

- Review target: `.agents/hooks/check_review_routing.py`.
- Location: top-level exception handler lines 454-459.
- Evidence:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        sys.exit(main(sys.argv[1:]))
    except Exception as exc:  # never ghost-fail; print and fail open
        sys.stderr.write("check_review_routing: internal error, allowing: %s\n" % exc)
        sys.exit(0)
```

The validation overlay says unknown findings and wrapper-internal errors default to `GATE FAIL`, never `INFO`; this checker's own detection contract only justifies fail-open for infrastructure gaps such as missing Git/base resolution. The blanket `except Exception` converts any strict-mode implementation bug after startup into a green CI step.

- Impact: EP-35 can report success when the checker itself crashes for a non-infrastructure reason. That weakens "preserve real failure visibility" for this new gate. The risk is partly inherited from sibling gates, but this change adds another strict CI gate with the same behavior.
- Minimum closure condition: Keep explicit fail-open only around known infrastructure gaps (`git` unavailable, base ref unresolvable, timeout where explicitly classified as infra). For `--strict` and `--selftest`, unexpected internal exceptions should exit nonzero. If report/commit-msg modes need advisory behavior, scope the fail-open there instead of using a blanket process-level catch.
- Next authorized action: Owner/implementer decision. This is broader than a one-line patch if the project wants all strict hooks to share the same error-bucket behavior, but EP-35 should not add a new strict gate that contradicts the validation-gate error policy.
- Patch queue: not authorized by this review report.

## Non-Finding Notes

- The branch's current PR-range gate passes because commit `adf6af3a` carries `review_routing_status: not_needed -- governance-substrate lane adjudicated in-chat with the owner this turn; no Review Timing Advisory was carried (the gate itself is the deliverable)`.
- The checker intentionally verifies disposition presence and shape only. This review does not treat the truth of `not_needed`, the quality of a filed review, or whether review should have been recommended as mechanically checkable by EP-35.
- Adding any review artifact under `docs/prompts/reviews/` or `docs/review-outputs/` satisfies the gate by shape. That is permissive, but it matches the stated "shape only" boundary and is not reported as a bug here.

## Review Use Boundary

Review findings are decision input only. They are not approval, validation, mandatory remediation, readiness, or executor-ready patch authority until the Chief Architect separately accepts or authorizes them.

This is an advisory implementation/code review. No formal Orca implementation-review lane verdict, validation pass/fail claim, mandatory remediation, approval, readiness claim, or patch queue is emitted.
