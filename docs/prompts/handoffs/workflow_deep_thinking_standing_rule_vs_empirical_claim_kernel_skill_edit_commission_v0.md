# Commission — encode "deductive standing-rule vs empirical generalization" into the `workflow-deep-thinking` kernel skill (kernel-skill source edit; gated + reviewed)

## Role and target

You are operating in the **canonical source repository of the `workflow-deep-thinking`
workflow-kernel skill** — wherever that skill's source-of-truth actually lives. Your job
is to make one small, domain-agnostic addition to that skill's reasoning discipline,
then route it through the skill's own review and deployment process.

**Before editing, confirm the target:**

- Edit the skill's **canonical source**, not a runtime copy. The installed user-level
  copy at `~/.claude/skills/workflow-deep-thinking` is a deploy target, **not** the
  source of truth — do not edit it as if it were.
- This rule does **not** live in the Orca repo. Orca holds only an application of it.
  Do not add this change to Orca.
- If you cannot positively identify the skill's canonical source, **stop and report**
  `BLOCKED_SOURCE_UNCONFIRMED` rather than editing a copy.

## What to encode (domain-agnostic — no project facts)

Add a rule to `workflow-deep-thinking`'s **Strict Claims** handling (or its decision
discipline, wherever the skill stabilizes "what is proven vs not proven"). The skill
currently distinguishes proven from not-proven but does **not** carve out claims that
need no empirical evidence because they are deductively entailed. Encode that carve-out:

> **Distinguish a deductive standing-rule from an empirical generalization.**
>
> - A claim **entailed by already-adopted premises/doctrine** is a *standing rule*: it
>   needs **no empirical proof-case**. The case or observation that surfaced it makes us
>   *notice* it, not *establish* it — so demanding cases to "prove" it is a category
>   error. Its authority is **derived** from the premises it follows from.
> - A **contingent claim about how something behaves across the world** is an *empirical
>   generalization*: it needs **sufficient cases (N≥K)**; a single instance cannot carry
>   it. Its authority is **evidential**.
>
> **Classifying test:** *Could the claim be false even if the governing premises/doctrine
> are internally consistent?* **No → standing rule** (entailed; no proof-case needed).
> **Yes → empirical** (needs cases). When a claim mixes both, split it: grade the
> entailed part as a standing rule and the contingent part as empirical.

Keep it **project-agnostic**: state it in general terms (premises, claims, cases). Do
**not** import any domain example (no demand-reads, no grading, no Orca vocabulary). Use
the smallest wording that fits the skill's existing voice and section structure; do not
restructure the skill or expand its scope.

## Hard constraints

- **Global blast radius.** This skill is used across every project that loads it. Treat
  the change as high-lock-in: minimal, voice-matching, reviewed before it lands.
- **Deployment-gated.** Route the change through the skill's own review and deployment
  process. Do not self-deploy, promote, shadow, or install. If the skill is "source-only
  until an explicit deployment turn," respect that — produce the source edit and stop at
  the deployment gate.
- **Adversarial review recommended before landing.** Given the blast radius, have an
  independent reviewer check that (a) the rule is correct general epistemics, (b) it does
  not contradict or duplicate the skill's existing Strict-Claims language, and (c) it
  carries no domain leakage. Findings-first; the reviewer holds no deployment authority.
- **No project leakage.** Nothing from the originating project (paths, examples, lifecycle
  labels, product facts) enters the skill text.

## Process

1. **Locate + confirm** the skill's canonical source (else `BLOCKED_SOURCE_UNCONFIRMED`).
2. **Draft** the smallest domain-agnostic edit into the Strict-Claims / decision-discipline
   section, matching the skill's existing voice.
3. **Adversarial review** the draft (correctness, non-duplication, no leakage); revise.
4. **Route to deployment** through the skill's own gate; stop at the gate if deployment is
   not authorized this turn.
5. **Report** the source path edited, the diff, the review outcome, and the deployment
   state (landed vs awaiting gate) — observed, not assumed.

## Boundaries / non-claims

- The deliverable for the Orca side was **this prompt**, not the edit. Nothing here grants
  Orca authority over the skill or claims the edit is done.
- This is an advisory commission. It is not validation, readiness, approval, or deployment
  authorization for the skill.
- The provenance pointer to Orca's grading-rubric doc is **context only** — its content
  must not be copied into the skill.
