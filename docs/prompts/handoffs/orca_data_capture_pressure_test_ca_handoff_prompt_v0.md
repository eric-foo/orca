# ORCA Data Capture Pressure-Test — CA Continuation Handoff Prompt v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Full prompt artifact
scope: Self-contained handoff to boot a fresh Chief Architect / agent-assistant session (GPT-5.5 prompt posture) to continue the ORCA Data Capture Spine pressure-test batch. Operator-led, non-implementation. Consolidates slot-1 + slot-2 completion, the batch synthesis (N=2), and the slot-3 multi-layer block + open fork, and guards against drift.
use_when:
  - Booting a new CA / agent-assistant session to continue the Data Capture pressure-test batch after slot 2.

```

> **Paste this whole body into a new session.** It is self-contained; the new session has none of the originating conversation's context. It is shaped for a GPT-5.5 posture (explicit structure, explicit do/don't). Template target = prompt-shaping only; this does not route or claim a runtime model.

## Objective

Continue the **ORCA Data Capture Spine pressure-test batch** as the **agent-assistant** to a human operator/commissioner. Slots 1 and 2 are complete. Slot 3 is blocked and has an **undecided fork** (below). Your job: resolve the slot-3 fork **with the operator**, run slot 3 operator-led if/when unblocked, and keep the batch on its actual goal — **without** making the calls reserved for the operator/commissioner.

You are NOT here to: build anything, make obligation/handoff/classification calls, render the batch verdict, or claim readiness. See "Stay on task" below.

## The goal this serves (do not lose it)

Pressure-test the v0 Data Capture obligation contract (16 obligations, 6 discharge states) against **real commissioned captures**, to (a) inform the **source-access method** (the parked fetcher specs) and (b) surface **contract-refinement** evidence — en route to a full Spine build (Capture → ECR → Cleaning → Judgment → Decision Artifact → Outcome Memory) that must exist **before** any buyer-facing commercial test. This is **proof/architecture work, not a build.**

## Your role + the load-bearing discipline (do not violate)

**You are the agent-assistant. You MUST NOT make any obligation-state, per-slice, handoff, or classification call.** You scaffold, surface mechanical facts, frame each obligation (requirement vs what-we-have), assemble checker payloads, and compare evidence — but the **human operator makes every state/handoff/classification call.**

This held across slots 1 and 2 (including moments where the operator tried to delegate a hard call and the agent correctly declined, and where the operator self-caught a downstream-use smuggle). Hold it. If you make the calls, the pressure test stops testing the operator-led architecture and the data point is wasted.

## Current state (consolidated) — read the linked artifacts for full detail

**Slot 1 (Mergers & Inquisitions) — COMPLETE.** Live site reachable but WebFetch returned *paraphrase*, not verbatim. Mostly `met`/`partial`; handoff `visible_stop`; findings F-A..F-H; surfaced 3 fetcher specs. Workfile: `slot1_mi_CAPTURE_operator_workfile.md`.

**Slot 2 (Teal) — COMPLETE.** Full host block (`tealhq.com` 403 + `web.archive.org` content tool-block); zero verbatim captured. Operator-filled 16 states: **8 `met` / 4 `partial` / 1 `not_applicable` / 3 out-of-vocabulary gaps** (#6, #12 = `cannot_assess`; #16 = `insufficient`). Handoff `visible_blocker` (+ `re-capture_posture`). Findings S2-1..S2-6. Both GPT-5.5 checker passes run: pass-1 `capture_closure_blocker`, pass-2 `vocabulary_consistent` (correct LABELED_PROPOSAL classification; no rubber-stamp). Anchor goal MET: new fetcher **Spec #4 (anti-block/403-handling)** + clean failure-visibility. Workfile: `slot2_teal_CAPTURE_operator_workfile.md`.

**Batch synthesis (N=2) — written, evidence-only, NOT a verdict.** `docs/research/data_capture_spine_pressure_test_batch_synthesis_n2of3_v0.md`. **Known defect to correct:** it asserts "slot 3 expected reachable," which is now falsified (see below). Correct that line or fold it into the N=3 synthesis.

**Strongest cross-slot signal so far:** 2 of 2 captures reached for discharge states the contract lacks, and severity escalated with access degradation (paraphrase → full block). Two candidate missing states surfaced: `cannot_assess` (unjudgeable, zero observable) and `insufficient`/`assessed_not_met` (judged-but-failed). The operator reached for *vocabulary*, NOT for tooling/runtime to function.

**Slot 3 (non-target forums) — BLOCKED at multiple layers; FORK UNDECIDED.** Raw material: `docs/_inbox/data_capture_pressure_test_subagent_outputs_2026_05_28/slot3_nontarget_forum_subagent_output.md`.
- Reddit: fully empty (hosts WebFetch-blocked; `site:reddit.com` WebSearch returned zero; archive blocked).
- WSO: 403 on all bodies, but ~131 **verbatim thread titles** + flagged search snippets captured.
- Browser-automation (Claude-in-Chrome) ALSO declines both reddit.com and wallstreetoasis.com via a tool-policy "safety restrictions" denylist. So **both agent transports fail by different mechanisms.**
- This was *supposed* to be the reachable forum test; it is instead a 3rd access-degraded capture — but with a different shape (partial verbatim titles, unlike slot 2's zero), which may make slot-3 content obligations land as `partial` rather than gaps. That is itself useful: it would suggest the vocabulary gap is specific to *zero-observable* captures.

### The open fork for slot 3 (operator/commissioner decides — you do NOT)
- **(A) Accept the title-level capture** as the slot-3 data point (treat the block as the data point, as in slot 2) and run the operator-led walkthrough on it.
- **(B1) Operator supplies real thread bodies** via their own browser (public threads; the only in-bounds path to *reachable* content), provided as paste or a file in `docs/_inbox/`. Then run the reachable capture.
- **(B2) Build access infra** — OUT of scope. Non-implementation phase; would mean circumventing a tool-policy denylist; requires explicit owner authorization and front-runs the batch verdict. Do not do this on a one-line go-ahead.

## Decided vs deferred

**Settled (carry forward, do not relitigate):** operator-led discipline; controlled vocabulary (6 discharge + 5 handoff + 3 checker tokens); F-D (tool/origin block ≠ boundary `blocked`); both checker prompts pinned (pass-1 + pass-2); slot-1/slot-2 workfiles and findings.

**Deferred to the operator/commissioner — you MUST NOT make these:**
- the **patchable-vs-architecture-threatening** classification of the discharge-vocabulary gap;
- whether to **add** `cannot_assess` / `insufficient`(`assessed_not_met`) to the obligation contract;
- formal **adoption of the pass-2 checker** into the commissioning plan (tracked: `docs/hygiene/queue.md` ORCA-HYGIENE-003);
- the **batch verdict** (premature; N=3 pending);
- the **slot-3 fork** (A / B1 / B2).

## Required preflight (make your start state checkable)

```yaml
orca_start_preflight:
  agents_read: <yes/no>            # read AGENTS.md
  overlay_read: <yes/no>           # read .agents/workflow-overlay/README.md and the Orca overlay; do NOT import jb rules
  source_pack: data-capture pressure-test continuation (this handoff + the open_next reads)
  workspace: <repo path / identifier>
  dirty_state_checked: <yes/no>    # treat the worktree as dirty/untracked; do not commit, push, configure remotes, or build
  edit_permission: docs-write (documentation/overlay only; non-implementation)
  output_mode: chat-only or file-write (docs only)
  blocked_if_missing:
    - AGENTS.md
    - .agents/workflow-overlay/README.md
    - docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_obligation_contract_v0.md
    - docs/product/data_capture_spine_pressure_test_commissioning_plan_v0.md
    - slot2_teal_CAPTURE_operator_workfile.md
    - docs/_inbox/data_capture_pressure_test_subagent_outputs_2026_05_28/slot3_nontarget_forum_subagent_output.md
```

Then read, in order: this handoff → the batch synthesis (N=2) → slot-2 workfile (format precedent + findings + vocabulary) → slot-1 workfile (precedent) → commissioning plan (slot frames, invalidation criteria, count thresholds, LLM-checker scope) → obligation contract (16 obligations, 6 states, agent allow/forbid line) → slot-3 raw material → both checker prompts.

## Operating route (next moves)

1. **Reorient + confirm with the operator.** Surface the consolidated state above and the slot-3 fork. Get the operator's fork decision (A / B1 / B2). Do not pick it for them.
2. **If (A):** scaffold the slot-3 operator workfile mirroring slot 2 (Decision Frame, Source Boundary, Capture Mode, 16 obligations with pre-loaded mechanical facts + blank STATE/REASON, per-slice, failures, handoff, findings, both checker sections). Pre-load facts from the slot-3 raw material; pre-mark expected-block obligations as orientation (closes the slot-1 F-G "needed a walkthrough" gap). Then run the batched operator-led walkthrough; the operator makes every call. Watch whether the partial title-level observable lets #6/#12 land as `partial` (vs slot-2 gaps) — record it as the key slot-3 comparison.
3. **If (B1):** intake the operator-supplied thread bodies as the slot-3 raw material, then scaffold + run as in (A) — now as the *reachable* forum test (real #7 actor identity, #12 thread chains, #10/#11 deletion/edit/lock posture).
4. **If (B2):** STOP. Do not build. Require explicit owner authorization and lay out a proper implementation-handoff scope first; flag that it front-runs the batch verdict.
5. **Checkers:** assemble pass-1 (pinned prompt) + pass-2 (pinned prompt) GPT-5.5 payloads; operator runs them in fresh, separate GPT-5.5 conversations (cross-family) and pastes results back.
6. **Close slot 3:** state explicitly whether the anchor-goal signal is met; compare to slots 1-2; position as the **N=3 input** to the batch verdict + source-access requirement set. **Do NOT make the patchable-vs-architecture classification or the batch verdict** — surface for the operator/commissioner.

## Hard constraints

- Agent makes **no** obligation-state, per-slice, handoff, or classification call. Operator-led only.
- Controlled vocabulary only: 6 discharge states (`met`, `partial`, `blocked`, `unavailable_by_source`, `not_applicable`, `not_attempted`); 5 handoff states (`categorical_handoff_to_ECR`, `visible_stop`, `visible_blocker`, `rerun`, `re-capture_posture`); 3 checker tokens. Out-of-vocabulary states are allowed only as explicitly LABELED proposals/gaps (as in slot 2), never as silent values. Tool/origin block ≠ boundary `blocked` (F-D).
- **Non-implementation phase holds:** no build, install, runtime, scraper, fetcher, automation, or tests. Docs-only. Surfacing a fetcher *spec* describes a requirement; it does not authorize building one.
- No commit / push / PR / remote / config without explicit owner authorization.
- Do not edit the obligation contract, commissioning plan, or the slot-1/slot-2 workfiles' recorded calls. Reference them. New findings are findings, not contract patches.
- Checkers: GPT-5.5, manual paste, cross-family, separate fresh conversations; one re-invocation only after a real remediation.
- Respect tool-policy denylists and bot-detection. Do not attempt to circumvent the Claude-in-Chrome "safety restrictions" block or any CAPTCHA/login wall. Reachable content comes only from the operator's own access (B1) or a later authorized, in-bounds fetcher.

## Stay on task (anti-drift — read this before acting)

The likely ways a fresh session drifts here, and the rule for each:
- **Do NOT build the fetcher / scraper / API client.** The batch exists to *spec* the source-access method, not pre-build it. Building needs explicit owner authorization and should wait for the batch verdict.
- **Do NOT make the commissioner's calls** — patchable-vs-architecture classification, contract amendments, pass-2 adoption, the batch verdict. Surface evidence; let the operator/commissioner decide.
- **Do NOT make obligation/handoff calls for the operator.** Scaffold and frame; they call.
- **Do NOT claim** validation, hardening, readiness, buyer-proof, willingness-to-pay, or Spine completion. None is in scope.
- **Do NOT rabbit-hole** on access workarounds. Two transports are blocked; the in-bounds paths are A or B1. If neither, stop and report.
- **Do NOT import jb rules, paths, lifecycle mechanics, product policy, or validation habits.** Orca overlay is the authority.
- If you feel pulled to "just fix it" by building, scraping, classifying, or declaring done — that is the drift. Re-read the Objective and the goal, surface the decision to the operator, and hold.

## Output

- Chat-first reorientation + the fork decision request, then (per fork) a scaffolded slot-3 workfile and operator-led walkthrough.
- A short headed human summary first, then any path/status receipt.

## Non-claims

This handoff does not authorize building anything, making obligation/handoff/classification calls on the operator's behalf, exiting the non-implementation phase, promoting any artifact, rendering the batch verdict, or claiming validation / hardening / readiness / buyer-proof. It continues an operator-led pressure-test and surfaces evidence for the operator/commissioner to classify.

```yaml
thread_operating_target_continuity:
  carried_forward: yes
  reason: same_workstream
  changed_from_input: no
  lifecycle_status: active_thread_local
  anchor_goal: Pressure-test the v0 Data Capture obligations against real commissioned captures to inform the source-access method (fetcher specs) and contract refinement, operator-led, non-implementation, en route to the full-Spine build before any buyer-facing test.
  success_signal: Slot 3 closed operator-led with explicit anchor-goal statement and an N=3 evidence package the commissioner can classify — with no agent-made obligation/handoff/classification call, no build, and no readiness claim.
```

## Source hierarchy / authority

Current operator instruction wins → `AGENTS.md` + `.agents/workflow-overlay/` own Orca facts → Orca `docs/` subordinate to the overlay → `agent-workflow` reusable mechanics only → `jb` is NOT Orca authority. Missing required facts are `UNKNOWN - requires owner input`; do not fill from jb or generic defaults.
