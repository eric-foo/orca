# Source Capture Authenticated Browser Snapshot Adversarial Code Review Prompt v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Review prompt
scope: Read-only adversarial code review prompt for Authenticated Browser Snapshot v0.
use_when:
  - Reviewing the uncommitted Authenticated Browser Snapshot v0 implementation before commit.

```

## Commission

Perform a read-only adversarial implementation/code review of the uncommitted
Authenticated Browser Snapshot v0 implementation in:

`C:\Users\vmon7\Desktop\projects\orca`

This review is decision input only. Do not patch files, commit, clean generated
outputs, launch real external logins, install packages, run browsers against
remote sites, or broaden into product planning. The review target is the
existing worktree implementation, not a substitute checkout.

## Required Method Sequence

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/workflow-overlay/README.md`.
2. REFERENCE-LOAD `workflow-deep-thinking`.
3. REFERENCE-LOAD `workflow-code-review`.
4. Do not APPLY either method yet.
5. SOURCE-LOAD all required authority, target, support, and validation evidence
   listed below.
6. Verify every pinned target hash below. If any hash mismatches, stop with
   `HASH_MISMATCH` and list the mismatched path, expected hash, actual hash,
   and nearest allowed next step.
7. Declare `SOURCE_CONTEXT_READY` only after the required sources and hashes are
   loaded. If any required source is missing, declare `SOURCE_CONTEXT_INCOMPLETE`.
8. Only after `SOURCE_CONTEXT_READY`, APPLY `workflow-deep-thinking` to frame
   failure modes and APPLY `workflow-code-review` in adversarial posture.
9. Write the full durable review report to:
   `docs/review-outputs/source_capture_authenticated_browser_snapshot_adversarial_code_review_v0.md`
10. After the report is written, return only a compact human summary plus a
    fenced `review_summary` YAML block in chat.

## Implementation Summary To Verify

The implementation is intended to add Authenticated Browser Snapshot v0:

- `auth_state.py` defines fixed session modes:
  - `free_account_created_session`
  - `paid_entitled_session`
  - `client_provided_session`
  - `consenting_coworker_session`
- auth-state files must live under ignored `orca-harness/_auth_state/`;
- bootstrap runner opens headed Playwright for manual login and writes local
  ignored storage-state JSON only;
- bootstrap writes no Source Capture Packet;
- authenticated packet runner loads an existing state label and writes a normal
  Source Capture Packet with rendered DOM, visible text, viewport screenshot,
  and metadata;
- packets may record session mode and state label, but must not copy, hash,
  print, or preserve storage-state JSON, cookies, tokens, or credentials;
- no username/password/token/cookie/profile CLI flags are allowed;
- no password-driven login automation, direct profile/cookie import,
  no-entitlement bypass, anti-detect, proxy, CAPTCHA solving, API SDK,
  scraper framework, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, buyer proof, or production runtime
  is authorized;
- anonymous Browser Snapshot behavior should remain compatible.

## Validation Evidence To Inspect

The implementation author observed:

```text
python -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider --basetemp pytest_tmp_auth_browser tests/unit/test_source_capture_packet.py tests/contract/test_source_capture_packet_no_runtime_imports.py tests/unit/test_source_capture_direct_http.py tests/contract/test_source_capture_direct_http_contract.py tests/unit/test_source_capture_media_asset.py tests/contract/test_source_capture_media_asset_contract.py tests/unit/test_source_capture_archive_org.py tests/contract/test_source_capture_archive_org_contract.py tests/unit/test_source_capture_browser_snapshot.py tests/unit/test_source_capture_authenticated_browser_snapshot.py tests/contract/test_source_capture_browser_snapshot_contract.py
```

Observed result:

```text
75 passed in 19.90s
```

Full harness:

```text
python -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider --basetemp pytest_tmp_full_auth_browser
```

Observed result:

```text
143 passed in 29.27s
```

Local authenticated browser smoke:

- sandbox run failed visibly with `WinError 5 Access is denied`, exit `3`, no
  packet;
- escalated local loopback run exited `0`;
- observed packet existed;
- `source_surface=authenticated_browser_snapshot`;
- `session_mode_seen=True`;
- raw files were:
  - `01_authenticated_browser_rendered_dom.html`
  - `02_authenticated_browser_visible_text.txt`
  - `03_authenticated_browser_viewport_screenshot.png`
  - `04_authenticated_browser_snapshot_metadata.json`
- `secret_found=False`;
- `auth_state_copied=False`.

Other checks:

- `git diff --check` on target files produced only LF/CRLF warnings and no
  whitespace errors.
- stale session-support scan hit only the literal search string inside the new
  propagation receipt.
- secret-flag scan over implementation files returned no hits for password,
  username, token, cookie, profile, storage-state-path CLI flags, `os.environ`,
  or `getpass`.
- `git status --ignored --short -- orca-harness\_auth_state orca-harness\_test_runs`
  showed both generated areas ignored (`!!`), with unrelated pre-existing
  permission warnings under `_test_runs`.

## Review Questions

Be adversarial about material implementation risks:

1. Can storage-state JSON, cookies, tokens, localStorage values, or auth-state
   file paths leak into `manifest.json`, `receipt.md`, raw packet files, stdout,
   errors, tests, or docs?
2. Is auth-state path validation strong enough to prevent path traversal,
   packet-output placement, fixture/report placement, or accidental commit of
   session state?
3. Does the bootstrap runner truly write no packet and avoid credential
   handling/password automation?
4. Does the authenticated packet runner preserve failure visibility, especially
   missing/invalid state, browser failures, login wall/challenge visibility,
   output collisions, and packet writer failures?
5. Does the implementation preserve anonymous Browser Snapshot behavior and
   non-claims?
6. Are the fixed session modes consistent with Orca source-access boundary
   doctrine and hard stops?
7. Do the docs over-authorize anything beyond manual-login Playwright
   storage-state v0?
8. Is the direction-change propagation receipt complete and accurate for this
   toolbox status change?
9. Are tests strong enough to catch the highest-risk regressions: state leakage,
   path traversal, forbidden flags, no-packet bootstrap, state-loaded metadata,
   and login-wall limitation behavior?
10. Does any code path create fake success, validation/readiness claims, or
    ECR/Cleaning/Judgment leakage?

## Findings Standard

Report findings first, ordered by severity. Use:

- `critical`: defect can leak credentials/session state, silently bypass hard
  stops, create fake source-capture success, or materially corrupt packet
  evidence.
- `major`: defect can mislead agents, weaken access/session safety, break
  authenticated capture semantics, or leave a material test gap before commit.
- `minor`: bounded correctness, documentation, test, or maintainability issue
  that should be considered but does not block commit by itself.
- `advisory`: optional hardening or future-work note.

Every actionable finding must include:

- finding id;
- severity;
- location;
- implementation evidence;
- authority/evidence basis;
- impact;
- minimum closure condition;
- next authorized action.

Do not emit `patch_queue_entry`; this is read-only review.

## Output Contract

Write the full durable report to:

`docs/review-outputs/source_capture_authenticated_browser_snapshot_adversarial_code_review_v0.md`

After successful write, return a concise chat summary plus:

```yaml

Review-use boundary: findings are decision input only. This review does not
approve, validate, require remediation, authorize patches, authorize commits,
or authorize production/source-system runtime.
