# Source Capture Authenticated Browser Snapshot Post-Patch Blast-Radius Recheck Prompt v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Review prompt
scope: Bounded adversarial code-review recheck for the Authenticated Browser Snapshot v0 post-patch changes.
use_when:
  - Verifying closure of M-01 and M-02 from the prior authenticated browser snapshot adversarial code review.
  - Deciding whether the patched Authenticated Browser Snapshot v0 implementation is safe to commit.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
```

## Objective

Run a read-only, bounded post-patch blast-radius recheck of the Authenticated
Browser Snapshot v0 implementation in the Orca workspace.

The review must answer only this closure question:

```text
Did the post-review patch close M-01 and M-02 from the prior adversarial code
review without introducing a blocker or major regression in credential/session
leakage, auth-state path containment, provenance accuracy, staging cleanup,
anonymous browser compatibility, source-access boundary compliance, or docs
over-authorization?
```

Do not perform a fresh full architecture review, do not broaden into unrelated
Source Capture Toolbox adapters, and do not patch files.

## Required Method Sequence

Follow this sequence exactly:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/workflow-overlay/README.md`.
2. REFERENCE-LOAD `workflow-deep-thinking`.
3. REFERENCE-LOAD `workflow-code-review`.
4. Do not APPLY either method yet.
5. SOURCE-LOAD all required authority files, prior review output, and current
   target files listed below.
6. Verify all SHA256 pins listed below.
7. Declare `SOURCE_CONTEXT_READY` if all required files were loaded and all
   hashes matched, or `SOURCE_CONTEXT_INCOMPLETE` / `HASH_MISMATCH` with exact
   details and stop before review claims.
8. APPLY `workflow-deep-thinking` to frame the closure risks.
9. APPLY `workflow-code-review` in bounded recheck posture.
10. Write the durable review report to the required output path.
11. Return only a compact chat summary plus courier YAML after the report write
    succeeds.

Reusable workflow skills are method guidance only, not Orca authority.

## Prior Findings To Recheck

Close only these prior major findings unless the patch introduces a new blocker
or major issue inside the touched scope:

### M-01

```text
Session mode not bound to auth-state file; packet can record wrong mode;
provenance misrepresentation risk.
```

Minimum closure from prior review:

```text
Either:
(a) A mode-binding sidecar file is written by the bootstrap runner so the
    capture runner can validate that the declared mode at capture time matches
    the declared mode at bootstrap time; OR
(b) Docs explicitly disclose that session mode is operator declaration only.
```

Expected patch direction observed from implementation notes:

```text
The implementation chose (a): bootstrap writes a small local ignored
`*.meta.json` sidecar under `_auth_state/` containing state file name and
session mode. Authenticated capture validates the sidecar and rejects mismatched
session-mode declarations before calling the browser capture path.
```

### M-02

```text
No staging-file cleanup test for authenticated runner on packet-write failure.
```

Minimum closure from prior review:

```text
A test exists that forces packet-write failure after staging files are written,
asserts all four authenticated staging files are absent afterward, and asserts
no packet directory was created.
```

Expected patch direction observed from implementation notes:

```text
`test_authenticated_browser_runner_cleans_staged_files_when_packet_write_fails`
was added to the authenticated browser test file.
```

```

## Patch Scope

Treat the patch scope as:

- session-mode sidecar path and validation in `auth_state.py`;
- bootstrap runner sidecar write and stdout behavior;
- authenticated packet runner sidecar validation and login-wall heuristic;
- authenticated browser unit tests and browser snapshot contract tests;
- docs describing authenticated browser behavior and non-claims;
- product README direction-change propagation text for authenticated browser v0.

Do not review unrelated Source Capture adapters except where a patch changes a
shared contract test or shared public API.

## Review Questions

Answer these directly in the report:

1. Does the sidecar close M-01 by mechanically binding bootstrap-time session
   mode to capture-time session mode?
2. Can a missing, malformed, mismatched, or path-traversed sidecar create fake
   success, packet write, auth-state leakage, or unclear failure?
3. Does the sidecar introduce sensitive data into packets, raw files, receipt,
   stdout, metadata, docs, test output, or review outputs?
4. Does the bootstrap runner still write no Source Capture Packet and avoid
   password, username, cookie, token, profile, or storage-state-path CLI flags?
5. Does the capture runner reject mode mismatches before browser capture?
6. Does the authenticated staging cleanup test close M-02 with real failure-path
   coverage?
7. Did the patch preserve anonymous Browser Snapshot behavior?
8. Did the patch preserve auth-state path containment under ignored
   `_auth_state/` and avoid printing absolute auth-state paths?
9. Did docs accurately describe sidecar binding without over-authorizing
   password automation, profile/cookie import, anti-detect, proxy behavior,
   CAPTCHA solving, no-entitlement bypass, API use, ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment?
10. Did the product README direction-change propagation remain accurate, or did
    the patch require additional propagation surfaces?
11. Do the validation results reported by the implementer correspond to tests
    that would actually catch the prior failures?
12. Are there any patch-caused blocker or major regressions inside the touched
    scope?

## Expected Validation Evidence To Inspect

The implementer reported these observed results after the patch. Treat them as
evidence to inspect against source, not as proof to accept blindly:

```

## Severity Contract

Use these finding severities:

- `critical`: credential/session values or storage-state JSON can leak into
  committed packet artifacts or normal stdout/stderr; no-entitlement bypass,
  password automation, raw profile/cookie import, anti-detect, proxy, CAPTCHA,
  ECR/Cleaning/Judgment leakage, or fake source-success path introduced.
- `major`: M-01 or M-02 not actually closed; sidecar mismatch can produce false
  provenance; staging cleanup can leave authenticated artifacts on normal
  failure; docs materially over-authorize; validation cannot catch the closure
  failure.
- `minor`: bounded correctness or documentation issue that does not reopen
  M-01/M-02 and does not create credential leakage or false provenance.
- `advisory`: optional hardening or future-maintenance issue only.

For this bounded recheck, list new `minor` and `advisory` findings only if they
are patch-caused or materially affect commit/use of this authenticated browser
surface. Do not inventory unrelated pre-existing issues.

## Required Report Shape

Write the durable report to:

```text
docs/review-outputs/source_capture_authenticated_browser_snapshot_post_patch_blast_radius_recheck_v0.md
```

The report must include:

1. Retrieval header.
2. Preflight record.
3. Hash verification table.
4. `SOURCE_CONTEXT_READY` / incomplete declaration.
5. Method application declarations.
6. Closure status for M-01 and M-02.
7. Any new blocker/major findings, findings-first.
8. Bounded minor/advisory findings only when patch-caused and decision-relevant.
9. Non-findings for credential leakage, path traversal, bootstrap no-packet,
   anonymous compatibility, source-access boundary, and docs over-authorization
   if cleared.
10. Recommendation using one of:
    - `closure_confirmed_commit_unblocked`
    - `closure_confirmed_with_minor_advisory_carry`
    - `revise_before_commit`
    - `blocked_hash_or_source_context`
11. Review-use boundary:

```text
Review findings are decision input only. This report does not approve,
validate, require remediation, authorize patches, authorize commits, or authorize
production/runtime source capture. Commit, patch, or runtime use requires
separate owner action.
```

## Chat Return Shape

After the durable report is written and verified, return this compact YAML in
chat:

```yaml
review_summary:
  status: completed | blocked
  report_path: docs/review-outputs/source_capture_authenticated_browser_snapshot_post_patch_blast_radius_recheck_v0.md
  recommendation: closure_confirmed_commit_unblocked | closure_confirmed_with_minor_advisory_carry | revise_before_commit | blocked_hash_or_source_context
  closure_status_by_finding:
    M-01: closed | open | not_assessable
    M-02: closed | open | not_assessable
  new_blocking_or_major_findings: []
  advisory_or_minor_carries: []
  next_action: "<one sentence>"
```

Do not patch files. Do not stage, commit, push, install, run browsers, use
network, or create packets. This is read-only review plus durable report write
only.
