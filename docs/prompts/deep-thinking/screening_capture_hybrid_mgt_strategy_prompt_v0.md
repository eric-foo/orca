scope: >
  Paste-ready strategy prompt for a ChatGPT-style reasoning lane to decide the
  mini-god-tier shape for combining screening reads with capture: screen first,
  capture only when the gate is satisfied, and pressure-test the tempting
  "capture if it feels okay" boundary collapse against the current screening-read
  build.
use_when:
  - Asking an external reasoning model to adjudicate screening-read versus capture
    hybrid architecture.
  - Pressure-testing whether a screen-gated capture or single-read delayed-commit
    design is the mini-god-tier target.
  - Forcing accepted residuals before adopting a hybrid source-access strategy.

Paste the body below into ChatGPT or another external reasoning model.

---

You are advising Orca on source-access architecture. Your task is to decide the
Mini God Tier strategy for combining **screening read** and **capture**.

Do not implement. Do not browse. Do not claim validation, readiness, legal
sufficiency, production safety, or source-access approval. This is a strategy
adjudication prompt.

## Prompt Preflight

preflight_defaults: `docs/prompts/templates/shared/orca_preflight_defaults_v0.md`
v0 -- constants bound; deltas stated below.

- Prompt artifact path:
  `docs/prompts/deep-thinking/screening_capture_hybrid_mgt_strategy_prompt_v0.md`.
- Authorization basis: current owner request to produce a ChatGPT strategy
  prompt for the screening/capture hybrid MGT decision.
- Output mode: `paste-ready-chat`; the receiving model returns a chat-only
  strategy memo and writes no files.
- Template kind: `deep-thinking`; no project-local deep-thinking template was
  bound, so this prompt uses the Orca prompt contract plus the source capsule
  below.
- Edit permission: `read-only` for the receiving model; no repository edits,
  patches, captures, packets, manifests, ECR records, or runtime actions.
- Target files/dirs for context only:
  `docs/workflows/screening_read_service_build_receipt_v0.md`,
  `docs/workflows/screening_read_reusable_findings_v0.md`,
  `docs/decisions/screening_reddit_read_route_decision_v0.md`,
  `docs/decisions/orca_mini_god_tier_doctrine_v0.md`,
  `orca-harness/source_capture/screening_read.py`, and
  `orca-harness/source_capture/screening_browser_read.py`.
- Branch/reference at authoring:
  `codex/screening-read-service-build` at
  `a7d90f86b7e223a9740d6bcffdbdd45ca3331453`.
- Dirty-state allowance: receiving model should assume no repo access and use
  the source capsule below; if repo access exists, it must reread the named files
  and report source-context status.
- Source pack: bounded custom source capsule from the current screening-read PR
  plus the MGT doctrine summarized below.
- Repo map decision: not needed for the receiving model; this prompt already
  names its bounded source pack.
- Doctrine change decision: the receiving model may recommend a future
  architecture/lifecycle-boundary change, but this prompt does not authorize or
  perform that change.
- Isolation decision: authored in the existing screening-read service PR worktree
  because this prompt is a continuation of that workstream.
- Validation gates for the response: source-context status stated; five options
  compared; "capture if it feels okay" either rejected or converted into explicit
  criteria; accepted residuals named for any MGT recommendation; no validation,
  readiness, approval, or implementation claim.
- Thread operating target continuity: no active thread operating target is
  carried; this is a strategy prompt for a downstream reasoning lane.

## Objective

Decide whether Orca should combine screening and capture into a hybrid flow, and
if so what the mini-god-tier shape should be.

The owner's tempting idea is:

> Screen, then capture if it feels okay. Maybe ignore the boundary because the
> hybrid is cleaner.

Treat that as a candidate to pressure-test, not as an instruction to obey. Push
back hard if it creates silent over-collection, hidden ECR/packet writes, vague
human judgment, or an untestable source-access boundary.

## Mini God Tier Bar

Mini God Tier means: capture most of the maximal capability's value at much
lower cost and speed than a maximal architecture, while naming the accepted
residuals. It is not a validation claim or readiness claim.

Your output must include an **accepted residuals** list. For each residual, name:

- what is left undone;
- why that is acceptable now;
- what risk remains;
- what would trigger an upgrade.

If you cannot name accepted residuals, do not call the design MGT.

## Current Build Context

Orca now has a bounded screening-read build on PR branch
`codex/screening-read-service-build` at commit
`a7d90f86b7e223a9740d6bcffdbdd45ca3331453`.

Current screening entries:

- `source_capture.screening_read.screening_read(...)`
- `source_capture.screening_browser_read.screening_browser_read(...)`
- `source_capture.screening_extraction.extract_structured_listing_candidates(...)`

Current screening boundary:

- orchestrator-invoked, not walker-direct;
- one source, one bounded question, human-rate;
- logged-out public URLs only;
- entitlement gate before fetch;
- no standing crawler, scheduler, monitor, dashboard, or production runtime;
- no new fetch/search infrastructure;
- no Source Capture Packet, no packet manifest, no packet staging;
- no ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment touch;
- browser screening returns visible text and classifies `block_shell` on visible
  text, not full DOM.

Current reusable finding:

- For browser/interstitial pages, classify the rendered visible text. Full DOM
  can retain residual challenge scripts and false-positive as blocked.
- For same-shaped listing pages, extract by targeted row/card-local locators:
  container, title anchor, optional href filter/canonicalizer, row-local
  datetime, and range-sanity guard.
- Do not use page-wide date aggregates such as `min(all datetimes)`, because
  page chrome/sidebar dates can pollute candidate dates.

Live probes of the generic extractor succeeded on public listing pages:

- GitHub Blog: 18 candidates, all row-local datetimes known.
- Node.js Blog: 6 candidates, all row-local datetimes known.
- Astro Blog: 12 candidates, all row-local datetimes known.

Known limitation of the current build:

- It proves screen-light read/extraction behavior, not a hybrid commit-gate.
- It can add latency if the same page is later captured separately.
- It can see a page state that changes before capture.
- It deliberately does not write packets/ECR during screening.

## Options To Compare

Compare these options. You may add a hybrid only if it is materially different.

1. **Pure screening then separate capture**
   - Screening reads and extracts screen-light fields.
   - If the orchestrator decides the source is worth it, a separate capture run
     happens later.

2. **Boundary-collapse hybrid**
   - Screening captures if it "feels okay."
   - The same entry can silently produce durable capture artifacts.

3. **Screen-gated capture**
   - Screening remains pure.
   - A separate orchestrator route applies explicit gate criteria.
   - If the gate passes, it invokes the normal capture path as a separate
     posture and records that the capture was triggered by screening.

4. **Single-read delayed-commit capture**
   - Fetch/render once into ephemeral memory.
   - Run screening classification/extraction on the ephemeral result.
   - If the gate fails, discard with no durable artifact.
   - If the gate passes, explicitly commit the same result into the capture
     packet path.
   - The commit moment must be mechanically explicit and testable.

5. **Direct capture for admitted/high-confidence sources**
   - Skip screening when the source is already admitted, high-confidence,
     volatile, and the question requires durable evidence.

## Decision Criteria

Evaluate each option against:

- evidence hygiene;
- latency;
- page-state drift between screening and capture;
- auditability of the posture transition;
- implementation complexity;
- testability of "nothing durable before the gate";
- fit with human-rate / public-only / no standing crawler constraints;
- failure modes if a future agent misunderstands the design;
- how well it uses the current screening-read build.

## Hard Constraints

- Do not recommend hidden capture from inside `screening_read`.
- Do not make "feels okay" a gate. Convert it to explicit criteria or reject it.
- Do not create packet, manifest, ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment side effects before
  a capture gate has passed.
- Do not weaken public-only / entitlement-first / no-auth-bypass boundaries.
- Do not propose a standing crawler, scheduler, monitor, or production runtime.
- Do not rely on broad source discovery, generic crawling, or new fetch/search
  infrastructure.
- Do not treat MGT as proof, validation, readiness, or owner approval.

## Output Contract

Return a concise strategy memo with these sections:

1. **Direct Answer**
   - Is the ideal hybrid real?
   - Is "capture if it feels okay / ignore the boundary" acceptable?

2. **Recommended MGT Shape**
   - Name the target architecture.
   - State the smallest complete version.
   - State what current build pieces it reuses.

3. **Option Comparison**
   - Short table comparing the five options against the decision criteria.

4. **Gate Contract**
   - Propose explicit gate criteria for screen-to-capture promotion.
   - Include at least: content class, login/block-shell refusal, required
     extracted fields, bounded question/source id, public entitlement state, and
     no packet/ECR before gate.

5. **State Machine**
   - Name states and transitions.
   - Include `screening_read`, `screen_decision`, `capture_invoked`,
     `ephemeral_discarded`, and `packet_committed` or better equivalents.

6. **Accepted Residuals**
   - Mandatory for the MGT claim.
   - Include the residuals, risks, and upgrade triggers.

7. **Tests Required Before Build**
   - Boundary tests.
   - Gate tests.
   - No-packet/no-ECR-before-gate tests.
   - Drift/duplicate-fetch tests if relevant.
   - Single-read delayed-commit tests if recommended.

8. **Recommendation**
   - Recommend Tier 1 now, Tier 2 later, direct capture exceptions, or no hybrid.
   - Name the next artifact that should be written if the owner accepts the
     strategy.

## Strong Starting Hypothesis To Challenge

The likely answer is:

- MGT is **screen-gated capture now** plus a future **single-read delayed-commit**
  upgrade if latency becomes measured pain.
- `screening_read` itself stays pure.
- The orchestrator owns the gate and invokes capture.
- "Capture if it feels okay" is not acceptable unless translated into explicit,
  testable gate criteria.

Do not accept this hypothesis automatically. Attack it and replace it if a better
MGT design captures more value at lower cost with named accepted residuals.
