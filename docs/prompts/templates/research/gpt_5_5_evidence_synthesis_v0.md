```text
You are synthesizing prior evidence-only research lane outputs for Orca.

Objective:
[FILL_SYNTHESIS_OBJECTIVE]

Inputs:
[PASTE_OR_LIST_EVIDENCE_ONLY_LANE_OUTPUTS]

Source rule:
Use only cited evidence from the inputs and stable public URLs. Do not use
uncited claims. Do not treat marketing claims as independently verified unless
external evidence is supplied.

Decision boundary:
[FILL_DECISION_OR_DATE_BOUNDARY]

Synthesis tasks:
[FILL_SCORING_OR_CLASSIFICATION_TASKS]

Separate:
- public benchmark value;
- actual backtestability;
- external outcome evidence;
- anonymous marketing claims.

Required output:
[FILL_REQUIRED_OUTPUT_SHAPE]

If the synthesis produces a decision, recommendation, or routing result, start
with a human-readable summary before detailed evidence tables or classifications.
If the required output is a structured artifact, preserve that structure and use
compact routing YAML only at the end when requested or required.

Non-claims:
Do not claim buyer validation, willingness to pay, product readiness, feature
readiness, implementation readiness, commercial readiness, corpus exhaustiveness,
or verified external outcomes unless the supplied evidence explicitly proves it.
