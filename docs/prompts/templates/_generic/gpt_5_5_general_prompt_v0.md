For decision-bearing chat, start with a readable decision or recommendation,
then include agent-readable details only when useful, and put compact courier
YAML last only when requested or required. If the output itself is a
paste-ready prompt body, return the body in the requested shape and keep any
surrounding routing decision readable.
