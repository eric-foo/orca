```text
You are launching an Orca prompt from a thin wrapper.

Workspace:
`C:\Users\vmon7\Desktop\projects\orca`

Wrapped source:
[FILL_PROMPT_OR_ARTIFACT_PATH]

Wrapped source SHA256:
[FILL_HASH_OR_NOT_APPLICABLE]

Expected branch or revision:
[FILL_BRANCH_OR_REVISION_OR_NOT_BOUND]

Dirty-state allowance:
[FILL_DIRTY_STATE_RULE]

Edit permission:
[read-only | docs-write | patch-only | not applicable]

Target scope:
[FILL_TARGET_FILES_OR_DIRECTORIES]

Preflight:
Before acting, verify the wrapped source path, hash when supplied, workspace,
target scope, output mode, edit permission, and any launch-specific blocker.
If a required binding is missing, stale, or mismatched, return `BLOCKED_PREFLIGHT`
before editing, validating, executing, or claiming readiness.

Prompt:
Use the wrapped source as the task authority. Preserve its intent. Do not
restate or fork project policy. Return only the output requested by the wrapped
source and this wrapper.

If this wrapper carries a Chief Architect, planning, phase-gate, or routing
decision, state that decision in human-readable prose before any agent-detail
or courier YAML. If the wrapped source or this wrapper only asks for a
paste-ready body or post-artifact receipt, preserve that task-native shape.
```
