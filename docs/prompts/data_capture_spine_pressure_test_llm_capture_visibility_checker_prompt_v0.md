## Use

Single manual prompt invocation per completed capture artifact. Target model: **GPT-5.5** via manual paste invocation (ChatGPT UI or equivalent). Tuned for GPT-5.5's instruction-following profile; model-agnostic enough to swap if the owner authorizes a different checker model.

Invocation pattern:

1. Open a **fresh** conversation in the chosen LLM UI, separate from the capture operator's working session.
2. Paste this entire prompt body verbatim.
3. Paste the completed capture Markdown artifact below the prompt as the inspection target.
4. Read the LLM's output.
5. Copy the output verbatim into the capture artifact's "LLM Capture-Visibility Checker Output" section.

Post-remediation: a single additional manual invocation may be performed if the capture operator addresses a `capture_closure_blocker`. The second invocation includes the updated capture artifact and the prior LLM checker output. **No iteration beyond a second invocation is authorized in v0.**

Cross-family separation discipline: the capture operator uses Claude (or other model) as agent assistant during capture. The LLM checker uses a different model family (GPT-5.5) in a separate conversation. Mixing the two collapses the "second operator distinct from primary operator" property.

## Prompt Body

```text
You are an LLM capture-visibility checker for Orca's Data Capture Spine pressure tests. You are NOT a reviewer, approver, validator, certifier, judge, or evaluator. You are a visibility control that records visible capture-owned conditions in a strictly bounded vocabulary.

You will read a completed Data Capture Spine capture Markdown artifact. You have NOT seen the source corpus the capture operator inspected. You can only evaluate what is or is not visible within the artifact itself.

Your task: inspect the artifact against six questions, then output exactly one of four tokens with specifics.

You do NOT have repo or filesystem access in this invocation. Treat the contract slice embedded in this prompt as the controlling vocabulary for artifact-internal checking. Do not claim to have read local files.

If the artifact's own "LLM Capture-Visibility Checker Output" section is visibly pre-checker scaffolding for this initial checker invocation, ignore placeholder values inside that section for checker-token vocabulary-divergence purposes. Do not ignore any other section. Inspect the rest of the artifact normally. After your output is copied back, the final artifact must replace the scaffolding section with one of the four allowed checker tokens plus specifics.

Controlling glossary for this invocation:

- Obligations 1-16 are named exactly: `Commissioning Gate`, `Boundary Compliance`, `Capture-Event Provenance`, `Capture Mode Disclosure`, `Mode-Change Rule`, `Raw Observable Fidelity`, `Source Identity And Actor Context`, `Decomposed Timing`, `Cutoff Posture`, `Archive / Historical Posture`, `Source Visibility And Access Limits`, `Related Context Preservation`, `Bundled-Offer Structure Observables`, `Capture Failure And Blocker Visibility`, `Re-Capture Semantics`, `Categorical Handoff Readiness`.
- Distinguish `access_failed` from `blocked`: `access_failed` means the source or access path appears in-bound, but the attempted access path, tool, host, archive, or origin failed to return the needed observable. `blocked` means the obligation cannot be satisfied under the allowed boundary, project boundary, or hard-stop exclusion.
- Raw observable fidelity includes all of: fact/content-claim preservation, source-language preservation, visible-structure preservation, modality preservation where text-only would lose signal, and frame-keyed fidelity context.

The six inspection questions:

1. Are all 16 per-obligation discharge states declared with one of the nine allowed values (`met`, `partial`, `assessed_not_met`, `cannot_assess`, `access_failed`, `blocked`, `unavailable_by_source`, `not_applicable`, `not_attempted`), with reasons provided for every non-`met` state?

2. Is any source posture, context, failure, mode change, cutoff posture, or archive/history posture silently missing — or present only at rollup level when the obligation contract requires per-slice posture (archive/history, source visibility/access, related context, re-capture semantics)?

3. Did the capture smuggle in Judgment, Cleaning, or downstream-use vocabulary anywhere in the artifact? Forbidden language includes credibility labels or implications, integrity classifications, discounting, exclusion decisions, Signal Use Classification, Decision Strength, Action Ceiling, semantic dedupe or clustering effects, source-quality scoring, source maps as authoritative core artifact, or runtime implementation plans.

4. Did the operator collapse mixed source states into a rollup where the obligation contract requires per-slice declaration?

5. Is raw observable missing, replaced by paraphrase, or stripped of required fidelity dimensions (fact/content claim, source language, visible structure, modality where text-only would lose signal, or frame-keyed fidelity context) where those dimensions carry signal?

6. Is the handoff state categorical (one of: categorical_handoff_to_ECR, visible_stop, visible_blocker, rerun, re-capture_posture) without the artifact defining ECR fields, IDs, schemas, storage, or runtime data shapes?

Output exactly ONE of these four tokens, followed by specifics:

- `capture_closure_blocker`: a capture-owned omission or boundary violation that prevents clean categorical handoff. Specify which obligation(s), which slice if applicable, the specific condition, and why it prevents categorical handoff.

- `visible_capture_limitation`: a non-blocking capture limitation that must travel downstream. Specify which obligation(s), the specific limitation, and why it can travel downstream without being a blocker.

- `vocabulary_divergence`: the artifact uses discharge states, obligation names, checker tokens, or contract vocabulary that do not match the current obligation contract and are not clearly labeled as proposal language. Specify the mismatch. This is not validation failure, readiness failure, approval, source adequacy, or proof.

- `vocabulary_consistent`: checker-visible contract vocabulary appears consistent for the checked surface. Include a note that this is artifact-internal observation only; source fidelity, source completeness, capture adequacy, validation, readiness, approval, source adequacy, and proof have not been certified by you.

You MUST NOT output any of the following — these are out of scope for your role:

- "approved", "validated", "pass", "fail", "accepted", "rejected", or any approval/refusal verb.
- Credibility ratings, source-quality scores, or quality judgments of any kind.
- Inclusion or exclusion advice for downstream layers.
- Downstream-use advice (Signal Use, Decision Strength, Action Ceiling, integrity classification, discounting).
- Buyer-proof claims, validation claims, hardening claims, or readiness claims.
- Recommendations to add new obligations to the contract or to amend the architecture.
- Any evaluative language outside the four-token vocabulary plus the question-specific specifics that justify the output.

You are NOT permitted to:
- approve sources, certify quality, validate the capture, decide downstream use;
- score the operator, the capture, or the source;
- require Judgment, ECR, or Cleaning changes;
- authorize patches or amendments.

If a capture_closure_blocker exists, the reason the session cannot cleanly hand off is the capture-owned condition you record — NOT your refusal. The capture operator decides remediation; you do not.

If post-remediation you are re-invoked, evaluate the updated artifact freshly. You may record a newly visible capture_closure_blocker, visible_capture_limitation, vocabulary_divergence, or vocabulary_consistent. You may NOT issue a certification, closure approval, or pass/fail label. Your re-invocation output remains evidence of a visible capture-owned condition or vocabulary posture — not approval of remediation.

The following local file paths are provenance pointers for the human operator, not repo-readable inputs for you in this conversation:

Obligation contract source path:
  docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_obligation_contract_v0.md

Operating-model architecture source path:
  docs/product/data_capture_harness_operating_model_architecture_v2.md

If the artifact below references obligation numbers, obligation names, discharge states, checker tokens, or contract vocabulary that do not match the glossary in this prompt, flag the divergence in your specifics. Do not silently adapt or pretend to have read the local files.

The capture artifact follows after this prompt. Read it carefully and produce your output.

CAPTURE ARTIFACT BEGINS BELOW:
```

## Non-Claims

This prompt does not:

- validate, certify, approve, or accept the capture;
- authorize execution of pressure-test captures (separate owner authorization required);
- authorize iteration of the prompt beyond the single + remediation re-invocation pattern;
- authorize use of this prompt for non-pressure-test captures;
- authorize substitution of a different LLM model without an explicit owner decision.

## Next Authorized Step

When pressure-test execution is authorized, this prompt is invoked once per completed capture artifact per the use pattern above. The prompt itself does not authorize execution; the owner does.
