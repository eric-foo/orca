## Goal Handoff

- long_term_goal: Build Orca fragrance-native source capture and downstream evidence plumbing that can monitor specialist fragrance precursor demand without blurring raw capture, Data Lake, Projection, ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment responsibilities.
- anchor_goal: Transfer Fragrantica current-window capture facts to Data Lake, Projection, ECR, and Cleaning lanes with the right source-family classification and explicit completeness limits.
- success_signal: A cold downstream lane can classify the Fragrantica packet under `fragrance_native_database`, preserve the raw-key relationship, scope projection/ECR/Cleaning work, and avoid treating the current-window 210/310 review-card evidence as a complete Fragrantica review archive or as retail PDP.

## Open Decision / Fork

- decision: Whether the existing Fragrantica packet under `F:/orca-data-lake/raw/930/01KW7SGXRZHFTS372X391Z8GHV` should be accepted as the raw packet to sync, held/quarantined as an environment-root accident, or replayed as a fresh packet.
  - options: validate/admit existing packet; hold/quarantine and replay later; replay immediately under a deliberate Data Lake run.
  - already constrained / off the table: mutating raw in place; encoding source/date/product/completeness in the raw path; classifying Fragrantica as `retail_pdp`; treating current-window reviews as full archive.
  - recommendation and why: validate the existing packet first. If manifest/hash/admission checks pass, keep it as the observed raw packet fact and classify by manifest metadata. If routine provenance must be cleaner, replay to a new packet and mark this one as probe evidence.

## Drift Guard

- Fragrantica belongs to `fragrance_native_database`, not `retail_pdp`; otherwise merchant/verified-purchase/offer semantics leak into an enthusiast database.
- Raw physical path is opaque by-packet fanout only; no source family, date, URL, product, identity, content hash, or dedupe meaning belongs in the path.
- Current-window Fragrantica reviews are partial: direct HTTP has 210 review cards; CloakBrowser scroll diagnosis saw 310 unique review IDs; visible text still showed `Reviews (3.9K)` and the full-archive login prompt.
- No auth-gate bypass: full archive access in observed route requires login; use only own-entitled/manual route if owner later authorizes it.
- No ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, buyer-proof, demand, credibility, or commercial-readiness claim is created by this handoff.

## Inherited Context (does NOT flow to a new lane)

### Source-loading state to re-establish

- overlay source-loading policy: `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md`.
- targets to enter the ladder: this packet; `docs/research/orca_fragrance_native_database_live_probe_v0.md`; the Fragrantica direct receipt/manifest under `F:/orca-data-lake/raw/930/01KW7SGXRZHFTS372X391Z8GHV`; the CloakBrowser diagnostic receipt/manifest under `orca-harness/_test_runs/fragrance_native_20260629/fragrantica_cloakbrowser_scroll_diag_packet`; Data Lake raw/storage contracts; projection doctrine; ECR submap; Data/Cleaning boundary.
- already loaded, weak orientation only: AGENTS context supplied by user; overlay README/source-loading/decision-routing/prompt-orchestration/retrieval-metadata/artifact-folders; targeted Data Lake, projection, ECR, Cleaning sources; packet receipts/manifests; Fragrantica raw parse; Parfumo live endpoint probes.
- must load first before strict/actionable steps: AGENTS.md/current user instruction, overlay README/source-loading, this packet, Fragrantica packet receipts/manifests, Data Lake raw admission and storage contracts, and the receiving lane owner doc.
- load rule: receiver re-runs progressive source loading per overlay; this packet only seeds the ladder.

### Earlier-decided concepts and behaviors

- Data Lake is raw-truth shared foundation and does not own source capture execution, projection semantics, ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment. Verify in `orca/product/spines/data_lake/README.md` before strict lake ownership claims.
- Raw packet paths are `raw/<packet_shard>/<packet_id>/`, with shard from `sha256(packet_id)[:3]`, and carry no semantic meaning. Verify against raw-admission contract SHA256 `582D7612CC1C89CE8D92E71189AEDEEB749ADDE5DB13F9265DF77A79620282D7`.
- New source-family payloads target Attachment Records or derived/projection metadata, not new direct lake-core fields. Verify against storage contract SHA256 `0248FA723972AEFFD04220876229F1E116F6BB9855391855ABFBC05C2F98B262`.
- Projection is a mechanical re-derivable view over raw; carry or residualize, never author from prose. Verify against projection doctrine SHA256 `81AE300C0AC7A26641771C2A11C9E0CF690A7C8C2429228D73F036586583F01D`.
- ECR and Cleaning are sibling downstream lanes over raw/projection refs; they do not repair missing archive coverage or decide meaning. Verify against ECR submap SHA256 `C945C079D06F4D15A487BB99D9CB3431E1A8CF5AFDA1679424D1842E6C596F60` and Data/Cleaning boundary SHA256 `3D50EEA84071490B563A36ABE37F974654A820274EFD767FFB37FFAB05F2509D`.

## Active Objective

Transfer Fragrantica current-window capture diagnosis into the right Data Lake, Projection, ECR, and Cleaning continuation lane without turning a fragrance-native enthusiast database into retail PDP and without overstating review completeness.

## Exact Next Authorized Action

1. Data Lake lane: re-open the Fragrantica direct packet receipt/manifest, verify hashes and raw-admission criteria, then decide accept vs quarantine/replay. Keep physical path by packet shard; classify semantically by manifest metadata: `source_family=fragrance_native_database`, `source_surface=fragrantica_product_page_direct_http`, platform `fragrantica` in projection/attachment metadata, object type `fragrance_product`, product id `33519`, and source locator URL.
2. Projection lane: scope a `fragrance_native_database` mechanical projection over the raw packet. Minimum row groups: product snapshot, review-card current-window rows, review-tab/source-order facts, aggregate rating/performance facts, and residuals/loss ledger for archive incompleteness, no linked-media preservation, no review-attached-photo proof, and no full archive.
3. ECR lane: consume only raw/projection refs and source-visible/residualized facts. Do not merge projection fields into ECR posture fields and do not author scent meaning, quality, demand, credibility, or completeness from prose.
4. Cleaning lane: define non-destructive normalization only: review text cleanup, source-language/string normalization, mechanical length bins, author/display-name normalization with raw refs, and source-visible rating/performance enum carry. Do not decide sentiment, credibility, duplicate effect, independence, demand, exclusion, or action support.
5. Stop if the direct packet is missing, hashes fail, manifest source family/surface differs, or lake authority changed.
## Where To Classify It Under Data Lake

- Raw physical home: `raw/<packet_shard>/<packet_id>/`, currently observed as `F:/orca-data-lake/raw/930/01KW7SGXRZHFTS372X391Z8GHV`. The `930` shard is physical fanout only and must not be read as source, date, product, or classification.
- Lake key: `packet_id=01KW7SGXRZHFTS372X391Z8GHV`. Re-captures get new packet IDs; do not dedupe by URL into the same raw path.
- Manifest metadata classification:
  - `source_family: fragrance_native_database`
  - `source_surface: fragrantica_product_page_direct_http`
  - source locator: `https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Maison-Francis-Kurkdjian/Baccarat-Rouge-540-33519.html`
- Recommended projection/Attachment Record metadata, not lake-core path grammar:
  - `source_platform: fragrantica`
  - `source_object_type: fragrance_product`
  - `source_object_site_id: 33519`
  - `source_object_name: Baccarat Rouge 540`
  - `brand_or_house: Maison Francis Kurkdjian`
  - `evidence_surface_class: fragrance_native_product_review_current_window`
- Explicit negative classification: not `retail_pdp`, not `retail_review_substrate`, not retailer verified-purchase reviews, not merchant offer/price/availability substrate.
- Downstream derived home, if built later: `derived/<anchor_shard>/<raw-anchor>/<lane-namespace>/<record-id>`, with lane namespaces owned by projection/ECR/Cleaning. Do not freeze source taxonomy into the lake path.

  - visible text showed `Reviews (3.9K)` and `Sign in to access the full review archive`.
  - rendered DOM carried 310 unique `review_` IDs after scroll, still partial versus 3.9K.
- Quality boundary:
  - Long-form reviews are present and mechanically measurable.
  - Reviewer avatar/profile images are present in review cards.
  - Review-attached photos are not proven in current card evidence; linked media assets were not independently preserved.

## Source Gaps / Not-Proven Boundaries

- Fragrantica full review archive is login-gated in the observed route and not captured.
- Fragrantica endpoint route for full archive is not pinned in this packet; re-derive under capture playbook if needed.
- Review-attached photos are not proven; only reviewer/avatar images are proven in review cards.
- No fixture admission or routine Data Lake sync was run by this handoff.
- No full database coverage, full archive, demand proof, buyer proof, ECR readiness, Cleaning readiness, or Judgment quality is proven.
## Current Task State

- Completed:
  - Fragrantica direct HTTP packet exists in the configured external data root with source_family `fragrance_native_database` and source_surface `fragrantica_product_page_direct_http`.
  - Fragrantica current-window card integrity/quality fields were mechanically parsed from preserved bytes.
  - CloakBrowser scroll diagnostic exists in ignored scratch and shows more review IDs but still a login-gated archive boundary.
  - Parfumo diagnosis addendum was added to the research artifact; Parfumo is not the target of this handoff packet.
- Partially completed:
  - Data Lake sync/classification is specified for the receiver but not executed.
  - Mechanical projection row shape is recommended but not authored as code or schema.
  - ECR and Cleaning continuation boundaries are specified but not implemented.
- Broken or uncertain:
  - The existing Fragrantica direct packet landed in `F:/orca-data-lake` because `ORCA_DATA_ROOT` overrode the requested scratch output. Treat as generated packet fact until Data Lake receiving lane validates or replays it.
  - Full Fragrantica review archive capture remains unresolved behind the login/archive boundary.

## Workspace State

- Branch: `codex/fragrance-native-live-probe`
- Head before this docs turn: `b4641d65`
- Dirty or untracked state before handoff: clean worktree at `b4641d65`.
- Dirty or untracked state after writing the handoff file: expected modified `docs/research/orca_fragrance_native_database_live_probe_v0.md` and untracked `docs/workflows/fragrantica_capture_to_data_lake_projection_ecr_cleaning_handoff_v0.md`; receiver must run fresh `git status --short --branch`.
- Target files/artifacts: this handoff file; `docs/research/orca_fragrance_native_database_live_probe_v0.md`; Fragrantica direct packet under `F:/orca-data-lake/raw/930/01KW7SGXRZHFTS372X391Z8GHV`; CloakBrowser diagnostic under `orca-harness/_test_runs/fragrance_native_20260629/fragrantica_cloakbrowser_scroll_diag_packet`.
- Related worktrees or branches: main workspace is on unrelated dirty lane `codex/ig-reels-capture-spine`; do not edit or claim state from it for this lane.

## Frozen Decisions

- Decision: classify Fragrantica as `fragrance_native_database`, not `retail_pdp`.
  - Evidence: packet manifest/receipt source_family and source_surface; source character is fragrance-native enthusiast database, not merchant PDP.
  - Consequence: Projection/ECR/Cleaning must not import retailer PDP field assumptions.
- Decision: use raw packet metadata/Attachment Record/projection metadata for semantic classification; do not encode classification in raw path.
  - Evidence: Data Lake raw admission and physicality contracts.
  - Consequence: physical path remains `raw/<packet_shard>/<packet_id>/`.
- Decision: Fragrantica current-window capture is useful but incomplete.
  - Evidence: 210 direct cards, 310 CloakBrowser DOM IDs, visible `Reviews (3.9K)` and login archive prompt.
  - Consequence: projection must carry completeness residuals and raw-pull triggers.
- Decision: ECR/Cleaning do not get to repair missing review archive coverage.
  - Evidence: projection and ECR carry-or-residualize doctrine; Data/Cleaning boundary.
  - Consequence: absent full archive is a residual, not a cleaned value or observed zero.

## Mutable Questions

- Should Data Lake accept the existing external-root packet or require a deliberate replay?
  - Why still mutable: packet exists and hashes are visible, but it landed via environment override during a probe.
  - What would resolve it: receiving lane runs raw-admission checks and records accept/hold/replay decision.
- Should Fragrantica full archive be pursued later?
  - Why still mutable: public current-window data is useful; full archive is login-gated in observed route.
  - What would resolve it: owner authorizes own-entitled login/manual route, or a public non-auth route is re-derived under capture playbook.
- What exact projection schema should Fragrantica use?
  - Why still mutable: this packet names row groups and residuals, not a ratified schema.
  - What would resolve it: projection lane authors a bounded schema/adapter plan with tests.
- Should CloakBrowser scroll diagnostic be promoted, replayed, or kept scratch?
  - Why still mutable: it preserved more review IDs but is diagnostic and partial.
  - What would resolve it: Data Lake or Capture owner decides whether browser-rendered current-window DOM adds enough value beyond direct HTTP.

## Superseded / Dangerous-To-Reuse Context

- Treating Fragrantica as retail/PDP because it has product pages and reviews is dangerous. Current replacement: `fragrance_native_database` source family with Fragrantica-specific projection rows/residuals.
- Treating direct HTTP 200 plus 210 inline cards as complete Fragrantica capture is dangerous. Current replacement: current-window partial capture only.
- Treating Data Lake sync as moving the packet into a source-named folder is dangerous. Current replacement: opaque raw shard path plus manifest/projection/attachment metadata.

## Commands And Verification Evidence

- `git status --short --branch; git rev-parse --short HEAD; git branch --show-current`
  - Passed: yes.
  - Important output: live-probe worktree was clean at `b4641d65` on `codex/fragrance-native-live-probe` before docs edits.
  - Re-run target: run from `C:\Users\vmon7\Desktop\projects\orca\worktrees\fragrance-native-live-probe`.
- `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 <target files>`
  - Passed: yes.
  - Important output: source hashes are recorded in Authority And Source Ledger.
  - Re-run target: recompute hashes for every load-bearing file before acting.
- Python parse over Fragrantica direct packet and CloakBrowser DOM
  - Passed after one quoting rerun.
  - Important output: direct packet had 210 review cards with field counts/distributions above; CloakBrowser DOM had 310 unique review IDs; visible text carried `Reviews (3.9K)` and login archive prompt.
  - Re-run target: parse `F:/orca-data-lake/raw/930/01KW7SGXRZHFTS372X391Z8GHV/raw/01_http_response_body.bin` and the CloakBrowser DOM file.
- Parfumo live POST probes
  - Passed with network approval.
  - Important output: Parfumo addendum was updated in the research artifact; not load-bearing for Fragrantica handoff.
  - Re-run target: see `docs/research/orca_fragrance_native_database_live_probe_v0.md` addendum.
- Validation not run:
  - No code tests were run because this was a docs-only handoff/research update.
  - Recommended verification before commit or downstream use: `git diff --check -- docs/workflows/fragrantica_capture_to_data_lake_projection_ecr_cleaning_handoff_v0.md docs/research/orca_fragrance_native_database_live_probe_v0.md` and fresh `git status --short --branch`.

## Blockers And Risks

- Existing Fragrantica packet may be treated as formal Data Lake admission without raw-admission verification.
  - Evidence: research closeout says the packet landed in configured ORCA data root during completeness check and is a generated packet fact only.
  - Likely next action: Data Lake receiving lane runs admission/availability validation and records accept/hold/replay.
- Full archive login prompt could tempt unauthorized access or unbounded route escalation.
  - Evidence: direct/CloakBrowser artifacts contain the login archive prompt.
  - Likely next action: stop at current-window capture unless owner supplies own-entitled route or a new public route fact.
- Projection could silently drop positive/negative tabs, long reviews, or no-vote cards.
  - Evidence: tab counts and rating distribution include positive/negative cards and rating `0`/missing posture.
  - Likely next action: projection must carry tab/source-order and residuals/loss ledger.
- Cleaning could interpret review text sentiment or scent meaning.
  - Evidence: Cleaning boundary forbids credibility/exclusion/strength effects; Judgment owns interpretation.
  - Likely next action: Cleaning only normalizes non-destructively and records raw-to-cleaned trace.

## Confirm-Don't-Trust Load Checklist

- Load-bearing facts the receiver must re-verify before acting: branch/head/dirty state; handoff path; Fragrantica direct receipt/manifest/body hashes; direct current-window parse counts if used; CloakBrowser receipt/manifest/DOM hash if browser-scroll facts are used; Data Lake raw admission/path and storage contract; projection/ECR/Cleaning boundary rules.
- Compare targets: hashes and paths in Authority And Source Ledger; fresh `git status --short --branch`; fresh parse over preserved raw bytes; current overlay/Data Lake/projection/ECR/Cleaning source docs.
- Load outcomes:
  - `REUSE`: all load-bearing facts re-verified; continue exact next authorized action.
  - `PARTIAL_REUSE`: optional Parfumo or non-load-bearing context drifted; reuse verified Fragrantica/Data Lake facts.
  - `STALE_REREAD_REQUIRED`: handoff source docs, packet receipts, head, or dirty state drifted but can be re-derived.
  - `BLOCKED_DRIFT`: Fragrantica packet missing/hash mismatch, source_family/surface conflict, or workspace drift conflicts with expected lane.
  - `BLOCKED_MISSING_PACKET`: this handoff path or named Fragrantica packet is absent/unreadable.
  - `BLOCKED_UNVERIFIABLE`: any load-bearing claim lacks a compare target and cannot be re-derived.

## Do Not Forget

The right lake classification is `fragrance_native_database` plus Fragrantica-specific source-surface metadata. The raw path stays opaque; the current-window reviews stay partial; and ECR/Cleaning must carry residuals rather than repair or interpret missing archive coverage.
