# Repo Map Header Backlog Review Outputs Batch 1 v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Workflow retrieval hardening record
scope: Second targeted reduction of the repo-map retrieval-header backlog, covering the no-tools review-output family.
use_when:
  - Auditing the no-tools review-output header backlog reduction.
  - Continuing the post-PR-554 retrieval-header backlog without broad backfill.
  - Deciding why no-tools review outputs were grouped as a coherent slice.
open_next:

authority_boundary: retrieval_only
```

## Batch Scope

Commission trace: owner instruction to proceed after the prompt-header backlog batch reduced advisory health to 41 missing headers, 0 orphans.

Starting health for this slice:

- `header_index.py --health --verbose`: 41 missing headers, 0 orphans.
- Remaining review-output backlog: 34 files.

Accepted slice:

- Add fenced retrieval headers to the six no-tools review outputs:
  - `docs/review-outputs/no_tools_execution_foundation_blind_spot_adversarial_review_v0.md`
  - `docs/review-outputs/no_tools_execution_foundation_f01_f02_post_patch_adversarial_recheck_v0.md`
  - `docs/review-outputs/no_tools_probe_raw_api_adapter_adversarial_code_review_v0.md`
  - `docs/review-outputs/no_tools_probe_raw_api_adapter_post_patch_adversarial_recheck_v0.md`
  - `docs/review-outputs/no_tools_probe_runner_step04_adversarial_code_review_v0.md`
  - `docs/review-outputs/no_tools_probe_runner_step04_post_patch_adversarial_recheck_v0.md`

Rationale:

- These files are durable human-authored review outputs under `.agents/workflow-overlay/retrieval-metadata.md`.
- They form one coherent no-tools execution/probe review family.
- The headers are retrieval-only and do not change the review verdicts, source evidence, validation status, or readiness boundaries in the bodies.

Deferred:

- The remaining review outputs should be grouped by source-capture, ECR/data-capture posture, product/proof, and other coherent families.
- Hygiene packets and generated migration files remain deferred under the prior batch rationale.

Observed post-patch residual:

- `header_index.py --health --oneline`: 35 missing headers, 0 orphans.

## Non-Claims

- Not validation, readiness, approval, or proof that repo-map retrieval health is clean.
- Not a full historical backfill.
- Not a change to any review finding or recommendation.
- Not authorization for broad header sweeps or a standing gardener.
