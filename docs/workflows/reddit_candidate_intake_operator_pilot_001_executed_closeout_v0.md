# Reddit Candidate Intake Operator Pilot 001 Executed Closeout v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1

scope: >
  Records the first real no-live operator-supplied old Reddit HTML pilot for
  bounded Reddit Candidate URL Intake.
use_when:
  - Resuming from the first operator-supplied Reddit Candidate URL Intake pilot.

## Status

Status: `REAL_NO_LIVE_OPERATOR_PILOT_COMPLETE_CAPS_REACHED`.

The pilot consumed an operator-supplied static HTML file saved from old Reddit.
Candidate URL Intake did not fetch Reddit, invoke CloakBrowser/proxy, invoke
Source Capture Armory, read a thread page as input, call a `.json` endpoint, or
emit a Source Capture Packet.

```

## Observed Execution

The first run against the saved search page produced zero rows because old
Reddit search result titles use `search-title`, while the parser previously
recognized only `title`. Treating that as a true empty result would have hidden
a parser-surface gap.

Smallest complete implementation patch applied:

- `orca-harness/capture_spine/reddit_candidate_intake/projection.py` now
  recognizes `search-title` anchors as candidate title anchors;
- `orca-harness/tests/unit/test_reddit_candidate_intake.py` now covers
  `search-title` while still ignoring `search-comments` and thumbnail links.

Validation after the patch:

First three candidate URLs:

https://old.reddit.com/r/b2bmarketing/comments/1szt837/marketing_is_slowly_turning_into_engineering_and/
https://old.reddit.com/r/b2bmarketing/comments/1rqglht/i_run_cold_email_for_49_clients_right_now_heres/
```

The operator-supplied topic-context thread URL also appeared as a candidate row
because it was present in the saved search listing. It was not used as an intake
input.

## Boundary Checks

Observed output scan for raw HTML, parser output, author fields, user/profile
fields, comments fields, body fields, and the rejected thread title found no
forbidden output. The scan did find the originally supplied thread URL as a
candidate URL, which is allowed.

The output is candidate/provenance only:

- 0 candidate subreddit rows;
- 25 candidate thread URL rows;
- 0 outbound URL rows;
- no raw HTML;
- no thread body;
- no comments;
- no user/profile/author fields;
- no Source Capture Packet artifact;
- no Source Capture Armory execution;
- no Data Capture handoff;
- no ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, fixture admission, or source-quality score.

## Meaning

The first real no-live operator pilot succeeded at producing bounded candidate
thread URLs from an operator-supplied old Reddit search page. `caps_reached` is
not a coverage or sufficiency claim. It means the probe found at least the cap
limit and stopped.

The next decision is not more intake by default. The next decision is whether to:

1. open a separate promotion gate for one or more candidate URLs;
2. run a narrower or differently sorted no-live pilot if the candidate set is
   too broad;
3. scope a bounded live-access pilot only if live access is needed to improve
   candidate intake usefulness.

## Non-Claims

This closeout is not broad Reddit crawling, not thread capture, not comment
capture, not user/profile capture, not raw HTML persistence by Candidate URL
Intake, not Reddit `.json` intake, not live Reddit access by Candidate URL
Intake, not CloakBrowser/proxy validation, not Source Capture Armory execution,
not Source Capture Packet output, not Data Capture handoff, not ECR, not
Cleaning, not Judgment, not source-quality scoring, not fixture admission, not
commercial-use permission, not promotion, not capture authorization, not
deployment, not production runtime, not commit authorization, not push
authorization, and not PR authorization.
