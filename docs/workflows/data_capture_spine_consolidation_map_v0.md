## Current Reality Snapshot

- **Armory is the entrypoint.** `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/README.md`
  indexes components, build order, current gaps, and non-claims.
- **Anti-block HTTP ladder has a rung-1 arm + usage guide.** A header-complete
  stdlib anti-blocking HTTP fetch (`anti_blocking_http`, rung-1) plus a
  `block_shell` honest-success guard were built and live-proven against one
  Akamai 403 wall (Daimler IR PDFs) — container-level retrieval, one data point,
  not a settled capability. Introduced on the `feat/anti-block-http-ladder`
  branch (confirm merge state in git before assuming it is on main). See the
  anti-block ladder usage guide and the rung-resolution closeout in Areas.
- **Screening-read service is wired on PR branch.**
  `source_capture.screening_read.screening_read(...)` gives the screen
  orchestrator bounded public reads over Reddit/direct/anti-block HTTP without
  packets or ECR. `source_capture.screening_browser_read.screening_browser_read(...)`
  wraps CloakBrowser for public interstitial/browser reads and classifies
  `block_shell` on visible text. Same-shaped listing extraction uses
  `StructuredListingExtractionSpec` with row-local locators and range sanity.
  Start from `docs/workflows/screening_read_service_build_receipt_v0.md` and
  `docs/workflows/screening_read_reusable_findings_v0.md`.
- **Build authority is bounded.** The source-access tooling authorization owns
  first/second/third-tranche build scope. It now selects CloakBrowser as the
  primary anti-blocking backend.
- **Reddit pre-commercial route is source-specific.** Use the implemented
  anonymous CloakBrowser Snapshot runner for one supplied old Reddit/thread URL
  when anti-blocking browser capture is needed, prefer old Reddit HTML where
  available, keep capture low-volume and subreddit/thematic/thread-family
  bounded, then use archive capture where live capture is unnecessary or fails
  visibly.
- **CloakBrowser anonymous v0 is implemented.**
  `orca-harness/source_capture/adapters/cloakbrowser_snapshot.py` and
  `orca-harness/runners/run_source_capture_cloakbrowser_packet.py` preserve
  rendered DOM, visible text, a viewport screenshot, and method-provenance
  metadata for one supplied URL. This is not Reddit discovery/consolidation,
  parser execution, proxy/session behavior, storage, production runtime, or
  commercial use.
- **Reddit consolidation now has a planning thread.**
  `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/reddit_precommercial_capture_consolidation_planning_thread_v0.md`
  is the durable architectural planning artifact for packet-before-parser
  handoff, BeautifulSoup parser role, provenance-first consolidation shape, and
  implementation stop lines. It now carries Decision-Frame-or-candidate
  classification, non-promoting success tiers, Armory vocabulary reuse,
  packet-contamination stops, no source-discovery expansion, and the current
  candidate-intake destination gap.
- **Reddit Candidate URL Intake is separate from Armory capture.**
  `orca/product/spines/capture/core/contracts/candidate_intake/data_capture_spine_reddit_candidate_url_intake_crawler_architecture_v0.md`
  specializes the parent Candidate URL Intake contract for the operator-facing
  Reddit "crawler" under Capture Spine. It emits candidate
  subreddit/thread/outbound URL rows with provenance only. It does not capture
  bodies/comments/profiles, emit Source Capture Packets, invoke Armory by
  default, auto-promote URLs into capture units, or authorize broad crawling.
  The bounded live first-contact runner
  `orca-harness/runners/run_reddit_candidate_intake_live.py` may fetch one
  declared source URL under a run envelope and live-access authorization, then
  persist only candidate rows, provenance, and a live-run receipt. For promoted
  Reddit capture, the lane records the existing
  source-backed posture: old Reddit first, CloakBrowser as the approved primary
  anti-blocking route, and residential or rotating proxies not blanket stop
  conditions in the pre-commercial/free anti-blocking posture. That is
  downstream access context, not Armory execution in intake.
- **Reddit Graph Frontier Lane is accepted as a separate bounded planning lane.**
  `orca/product/spines/scanning/source_families/reddit/data_capture_spine_reddit_graph_frontier_lane_architecture_v0.md`
  owns the Graph Frontier Register shape. It may use a semantic/frontier agent
  to choose the next candidate seed and prepare the next bounded run, but every
  hop needs a new `run_id`, caps, exclusions, access mode, source-policy
  posture, and stop condition. It is not same-run traversal,
  Graph Frontier-owned live Reddit fetch, automatic capture, broad crawling,
  Source Capture, Data Capture, storage, scheduler, dashboard, or production
  runtime. Local register support exists under
  `orca-harness/capture_spine/reddit_graph_frontier/` for building a register
  from existing candidate output and preparing a next-run envelope with
  `execution_authorized: false`. Live first-contact fetch belongs to the
  Candidate URL Intake runner, not to the register. The operator-facing
  "crawling graph" runner
  `orca-harness/runners/run_reddit_graph_frontier_register.py` writes the
  register and optional non-executing next-run envelope from an existing
  Candidate URL Intake artifact.
- **LinkedIn Lane discovery planning is accepted as a bounded planning lane.**
  `orca/product/spines/scanning/source_families/linkedin/data_capture_spine_linkedin_discovery_planning_lane_architecture_v0.md`
  owns the LinkedIn Lane boundary for candidate businesses, organizations,
  senior decision makers, public professional actors, creators, and influential
  people. It treats supervised browser-assist as green for Orca personal /
  pre-commercial POC only when tagged `optional_poc_risk_mode`, bounded,
  operator-supervised, provenance-recorded, non-commercial, and minimized; under
  that mode it may use anti-blocking techniques (anti-detect/cloaked browser,
  residential/rotating proxies, in-browser JS-challenge handling) to reach
  discoverable or entitled surfaces, consistent with the unchanged source-access
  boundary. The lane emits candidate rows, Graph Frontier planning structure, and
  promotion receipts only; it does not authorize live LinkedIn runners,
  autonomous scraping, no-entitlement gate bypass to non-entitled data, contact
  harvesting, lead-list creation, follower/connection/commenter graph capture,
  profile body harvesting, Source Capture Packets, Data Capture handoff, storage,
  scheduler, dashboard, production runtime, commercial use, or Outreach Lane
  execution.
- **Reddit success-signal routing is preserved.**
  `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/reddit_precommercial_capture_consolidation_success_signal_architecture_v0.md`
  records the advisory architecture rationale for the success-signal patch and
  is not itself validation, readiness, capture authorization, storage
  authorization, source-quality scoring, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, or commercial
  Reddit authority.
- **Reddit cold `.json` is not the spine.** Treat cold anonymous `.json`
  endpoints as downgraded; current official guidance, developer reports, and
  Orca's 2026-06-08 bounded probes indicate cold `.json` access can fail with
  403/network-security blocks. The useful JSON path is warm same-context JSON:
  load the exact old Reddit HTML thread first, then fetch the same thread's
  `.json` in that same browser context, preserving both bodies and provenance.
- **BeautifulSoup is parser-only.** It can parse retrieved old Reddit HTML or
  archived HTML after preservation; it does not fetch, bypass blocking, solve JS,
  or replace packet provenance.
- **No broad crawling.** Subreddit/thematic/thread-family bounding is allowed for
  Reddit pre-commercial capture, but site-wide walking, generic harvesting,
  production monitoring, storage, dashboards, deployment, and production runtime
  remain outside this map.

- owner: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/contracts/obligation_contracts/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_obligation_contract_v0.md`

### Tenant payload attachment boundary

- summary: Accepted target boundary for tenant/source-family typed payloads:
  current `SourceCaptureSlice` payload fields are transitional/incumbent; new
  payload families target packet/slice-keyed logical extension envelopes.
- owner: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/packet_schema/source_capture_tenant_payload_attachment_boundary_v0.md`
- plain-language companion: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/packet_schema/source_capture_core_payload_split_explainer_v0.md`

### Data-lake mechanics map

- summary: Planning-only logical mechanics map for how raw
  `SourceCapturePacket` truth, stable core facts, typed payload envelopes,
  projection, ECR/SCR, Cleaning, and Judgment flow by key without selecting
  physical storage, schema migration, or projection cache.

### Retail/PDP typed-envelope probe

- summary: First non-IG logical fit check for the packet/slice-keyed typed-
  envelope boundary. Retail/PDP source-family payload can live outside direct
  `SourceCaptureSlice` fields while raw packet truth stays canonical and
  projection stays derived. It does not select storage or authorize runtime.
- owner: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_families/retail_pdp/retail_pdp_typed_envelope_probe_v0.md`

### Source-access boundary

- summary: Discoverable-or-entitled + disclosable standard, owner-accepted
  anti-blocking risk posture, and hard stops.

### Operating model / commissioning

- summary: Owner-accepted v2 Data Capture operating-model architecture,
  obligation baseline, lane thesis, and bounded pressure-test commissioning
  plan. These are pressure-test planning authorities, not validation,
  hardening, product readiness, runtime, ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment design.
- owners: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/operating_model/data_capture_harness_operating_model_architecture_v2_acceptance_decision_v0.md`,
  `orca/product/spines/capture/core/operating_model/data_capture_harness_operating_model_architecture_v2.md`,

  `orca/product/spines/capture/core/operating_model/data_capture_spine_pressure_test_commissioning_plan_v0.md`

### Candidate URL Intake

- summary: Generic Capture Spine parent contract for bounded candidate locator
  intake before promotion: run envelopes, candidate locator rows, outbound
  locator rows, provenance receipts, cap/coverage semantics, no-same-run
  traversal, subagent boundaries, promotion gates, and explicit non-outputs.
  It is not Source Capture Armory, Data Capture handoff, ECR, Cleaning,
  Judgment, fixture admission, source-quality scoring, or implementation
  authorization.
- owner: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/contracts/candidate_intake/data_capture_spine_candidate_url_intake_contract_v0.md`

### Corpus Intake (standing-capture)

- summary: Owner-ratified standing-capture sibling of the v0 commissioned
  obligation contract: the obligation home for recurring capture of an approved
  public signal into an append-only corpus BEFORE a Decision Frame (S1 standing
  charter gate, S2 series identity/pins, S3 declared-capped-stop-bounded cadence,
  S4 append-only integrity, S5 rebind gate, S6 manipulability flags ride forward,
  S7 never-a-feed lock). Inherits the v0 obligations (Ob.2-16) unchanged. Ratified,
  not pressure-tested; authorizes no build, scheduler, runtime, or source access.
- owner: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/contracts/corpus_intake/data_capture_spine_corpus_intake_obligation_contract_proposal_v0.md`

### Reddit pre-commercial planning thread

- summary: Architectural planning route for bounded Reddit capture and
  consolidation: exact old Reddit Direct HTTP first for supplied thread URLs
  when current old Reddit HTML is the capture target, CloakBrowser
  anti-blocking when Direct HTTP is unsuitable or blocked, packet-before-parser
  handoff, provenance-first consolidation fields, Decision-Frame-or-candidate
  classification, non-promoting success tiers, Armory vocabulary reuse, archive
  fallback, `.json` fallback posture, and implementation stop lines.
- owner: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/reddit_precommercial_capture_consolidation_planning_thread_v0.md`

### Reddit Candidate URL Intake

- summary: Capture Spine candidate-intake contract for the operator-facing
  bounded Reddit "crawler": candidate subreddit/thread/outbound URL rows plus
  provenance only, declared-and-capped related-surface candidate discovery
  without same-run traversal, CloakBrowser as approved primary downstream
  anti-blocking route, proxies not blanket stop conditions for pre-commercial
  capture, bounded live first-contact intake under a run envelope, no
  body/comment/profile capture, no Source Capture Packet
  output, and no automatic Data Capture handoff.
- owner: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/contracts/candidate_intake/data_capture_spine_reddit_candidate_url_intake_crawler_architecture_v0.md`

### Reddit Graph Frontier Lane

- summary: Accepted bounded graph/frontier scouting lane downstream of Reddit
  Candidate URL Intake. It writes a Graph Frontier Register of candidate nodes,
  edges, prior pointers, source surfaces, caps, source-policy posture, stop
  reasons, and non-claims; semantic/frontier selection may choose the next seed
  only by preparing a fresh bounded run. It does not authorize same-run
  traversal, Graph Frontier-owned live Reddit fetch, automatic capture, Source Capture Packets, Data
  Capture handoff, broad crawling, storage, scheduler, dashboard, production
  runtime, source-quality scoring, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, fixture admission, or
  commercial use. Operator-facing nickname: "crawling graph."
- owner: `orca/product/spines/scanning/source_families/reddit/data_capture_spine_reddit_graph_frontier_lane_architecture_v0.md`

### LinkedIn Lane Discovery Planning

- summary: Bounded LinkedIn-adjacent discovery and candidate-frontier lane for
  businesses, organizations, senior decision makers, public professional actors,
  creators, and influential people. It records candidate rows, provenance,
  visible influence numbers, privacy/minimization flags, bounded-watch posture,
  optional POC-risk mode guardrails, Graph Frontier planning structure, and
  promotion requirements. It does not authorize LinkedIn scraping, no-entitlement
  gate bypass to non-entitled data, contact harvesting, lead lists,
  follower/connection/commenter graph capture, profile
  body harvesting, Source Capture Packets, Data Capture handoff, Outreach Lane
  execution, storage, scheduler, dashboard, production runtime, or commercial
  use.
- owner: `orca/product/spines/scanning/source_families/linkedin/data_capture_spine_linkedin_discovery_planning_lane_architecture_v0.md`

### Reddit Candidate URL Intake Defaults

- summary: Recommended source-family default policy for bounded Reddit Candidate
  URL Intake: caps by `probe`, `working_batch`, and `high_recall_pass`;
  default-on/default-off candidate surfaces; outbound-link opt-in; monitored
  scopes default-off before a Decision Frame; continuation/widening rules;
  operator-owned promotion receipt; listing-provenance defaults; old-Reddit-
  first URL posture; downstream CloakBrowser/proxy setup not repeated in this
  lane; and bounded live runner scoping under a per-run envelope after owner
  acceptance. Pending owner acceptance; not validation, runtime authorization,
  Source Capture Packet output, or broad implementation execution.
- owner: `docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_reddit_candidate_url_intake_default_policy_decision_v0.md`

### Reddit Candidate URL Intake Search-Surface Handling

- summary: Lane-side handling note for no-live operator-supplied old Reddit
  search/listing HTML pilots. Records the `search-title` title-anchor rule,
  empty-result sanity checks, the difference between operator browser access and
  Candidate URL Intake access, and the separate candidate-subreddit discovery
  success signal for recommended/correlated subreddits with visible volume.
- owner: `docs/workflows/reddit_candidate_intake_old_reddit_search_surface_handling_v0.md`

### Reddit success-signal routing object

- summary: Advisory routing object explaining the Reddit success-signal
  hardening structure, including the candidate/scouting handoff gap and the
  reason the planning thread reuses existing Armory vocabulary instead of
  creating a Reddit-local ladder.
- owner: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/reddit_precommercial_capture_consolidation_success_signal_architecture_v0.md`

### Source Capture Armory

- summary: Product-facing component index, build order, current gaps, non-claims,
  and source-quality entrypoints.
- owner: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/README.md`

### IG creator-momentum projection helper

- summary: Offline packet-directory projection surface for existing IG Source Capture
  Packets. Materializes the view-only `metric_observations` row index from a
  packet directory or `manifest.json`; not live IG capture, scheduler, production
  store, momentum score, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, or at-scale readiness.

  `orca-harness/source_capture/ig_projection.py`, `orca-harness/runners/run_ig_creator_momentum_projection.py`

### Creator profile current view

- summary: Product/view contract for the one-stop current creator profile. It
  joins public-handle identity, per-content metric observations, aggregate
  influence rollups, and ideal-audience snapshots without turning the identity
  ledger into one giant ledger.
- owner: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_families/social_media/creator_registry/creator_profile_current_view_spec_v0.md`

### Creator Signal cross-spine surface

- summary: Product-facing creator intelligence surface over the Capture-owned
  `creator_profile_current` view. It owns operator/buyer presentation, aggregate
  influence display, ideal/content-fit audience display, freshness, limitations,
  and source drill-back. It does not own Capture identity rows, metric
  observations, metric rollup computation, ideal-audience inference schemas,
  SQLite/data-lake storage, dashboard runtime, live capture, outreach, lead-list
  export, or a public creator directory.
- owner: `orca/product/spines/creator_signal/creator_intelligence_profile_surface_v0.md`

### Retail/PDP Projection Playbook

- summary: Retail/PDP raw-packet-to-projection contract for Amazon, Sephora, and
  Ulta: raw inputs, allowed projected rows, binding map requirements, residual
  meanings, retailer-specific target-binding limits, and the playbook-first
  boundary before auto-project wiring or ECR sequencing.
- owner: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_families/retail_pdp/retail_pdp_projection_playbook_v0.md`

### Anti-block capture ladder

- summary: How to choose and honestly escalate anti-block rungs (0 `direct_http`
  control → 1 header-complete `anti_blocking_http` → 2 `curl_cffi` TLS/JA3
  (gated) → 3 `browser_snapshot` → heavier rungs) against 403 bot-blocks; how to
  judge success honestly (`block_shell` + a container-level discriminator); and
  the live Daimler/Akamai rung-1 result. Cost-ordered, not capability-ordered;
  browser rungs do not capture file bytes; one data point, not a settled
  capability.

  `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/source_capture_anti_blocking_http_ladder_daimler_rung_resolution_closeout_v0.md`

### Packet lifecycle / retention

- summary: Scratch packet lifecycle, durable citation, retention/sensitivity
  handling, and separate fixture admission boundaries.
- owner: `docs/decisions/source_capture_packet_fixture_retention_sensitivity_decision_v0.md`

### Harness implementation

- summary: Current runnable packet writers, adapters, runner docs, and tests.
  Implementation reality must be checked in code; docs may be ahead of runners.
  Capture Spine local support includes Reddit Candidate URL Intake and Reddit
  Graph Frontier register/receipt helpers under `orca-harness/capture_spine/`,
  plus the bounded live Candidate URL Intake runner under
  `orca-harness/runners/run_reddit_candidate_intake_live.py` and the Graph
  Frontier register runner under
  `orca-harness/runners/run_reddit_graph_frontier_register.py`; these are not
  source-capture packet runners, Source Capture Armory execution, storage,
  scheduler, dashboard, or production runtime.
  CloakBrowser anonymous non-persistent v0 has a live engine and packet runner
  for one explicitly supplied URL; proxy/session behavior, Reddit
  discovery/consolidation, storage, production runtime, and commercial use are
  not implemented by that runner.
- owners: `orca-harness/docs/source_capture_agent_runbook.md`,
  `orca-harness/docs/adapter_author_contract.md`, `orca-harness/source_capture/`,
  `orca-harness/runners/`

### Source-quality support

- summary: Mini God-Tier source-quality posture, queue/report template,
  state assembler, and operational closeouts. These do not validate sources or
  admit fixtures.
- owners: `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/source_quality_mini_god_tier_profile_v0.md`,
  `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/source_quality_source_unit_queue_template_v0.md`,
  `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/source_quality_state_assembler_v0.md`
