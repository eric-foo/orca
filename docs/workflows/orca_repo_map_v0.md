# Orca Repo Map v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Repository map
scope: Compact navigation map for Orca source loading and prompt setup.
use_when:
  - Choosing a bounded source pack before a CA prompt, review prompt, or product artifact.
  - Orienting a new thread without bulk-loading the repository.
  - Deciding which product, prompt, review, research, or workflow files are adjacent to a task.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
open_next:
  - .agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md
  - .agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md
stale_if:
  - New top-level docs folders are added.
  - Core Spine, Data Capture Spine, Cleaning Spine, Judgment Spine, offer, proof, or prompt families are materially reorganized.
  - A later repo-map artifact supersedes this file.

## How To Use This Map

Use this map to choose files. Do not treat it as product authority.

For source precedence, open `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md`.
For source-loading budgets, open `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md`.
For artifact retrievability, body-opening shape, stale/recheck patterns, and
temporary-artifact anti-rot guidance, open
`docs/workflows/artifact_retrievability_guide.md`.

## Inbox Warning

`docs/_inbox/` is non-authoritative. It currently contains contaminated
method-validation replay outputs and compacted-run material. Do not read or
promote those files unless the task explicitly concerns contamination,
recovery, hygiene, or comparison against canonical promoted files.

## Recommended Read Packs

### Data Capture Spine Setup CA

Use the canonical read-pack rule in
`.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md#data-capture-spine-ca-read-pack`.
This map is only a navigation aid and must not fork the Data Capture Spine
source-loading rule.

Navigation pointers for that pack live in the Product Anchor Files and Core
Spine Files sections above. Do not read the target files in full by default.
Use the targeted sections named by `source-loading.md`, then expand only when a
concrete source gap could change the Data Capture Spine CA prompt.

Exclude by default:

- method-validation replays;
- first proof run packets;
- review outputs;
- research corpus;
- `docs/_inbox/`.

### Data Capture Setup / Pressure-Test Packet

Use this packet when continuing Data Capture Spine setup, obligation-contract
pressure testing, or source-family fixture checks. This is a navigation pointer
only; it does not claim that Data Capture Spine is closed, source-of-truth
promoted, accepted, formally validated, ready for ECR/Cleaning handoff,
implementation-ready, runtime-ready, or Cleaning-complete.

Start with:

- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_pressure_test_synthesis_usage_note_v0.md`
- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_obligation_contract_v0.md`
- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_full_fixture_synthesis_v0.md`
- `docs/review-outputs/adversarial-artifact-reviews/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_full_fixture_synthesis_adversarial_review_v0.md`
- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_remaining_fixture_plan_v0.md`
- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_context_preservation_note_v0.md`
- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_architecture_blueprint_v0.md`
- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_pressure_test_threaded_forum_reddit_api_pricing_v0.md`
- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_pressure_test_public_sector_package_milwaukee_fiscal_crossroads_v0.md`
- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_pressure_test_review_surface_v0.md`
- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_pressure_test_docs_changelog_versioned_page_v0.md`
- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_data_capture_spine_pressure_test_archive_history_recapture_v0.md`

Current pressure-test or setup handoffs should pin a freshly computed hash of
the obligation contract. The last reported working hash for the contract was
`A9B4D61226571ADCADD96504D361A7EBEB00775C315708AE53495E2F60EEE1DF`, but
receiving lanes should recompute it before strict source-pinning claims.

Current post-clarification synthesis hash was last reported as
`46103142927A7EA7A4B61F10E0EF029614814F36438F4359C4B69B838E6C6126`. The
pressure-test synthesis usage note hash was last reported as
`7A5C5B26AA6F95C99428D7C7EB5014FD172E47DF57BFC2D92C68A1994DECAE29`. Recompute
before strict claims.

Note: older fixture headers and the adversarial review may reference earlier
synthesis or contract hashes. Treat those as historical provenance unless the
receiving lane is explicitly reviewing that older state. The adversarial review
is useful for rationale and optional clarification findings, but it reviewed
the pre-clarification synthesis hash recorded inside that report.

### Offer Or Buyer Proof Work

Start with:

- `docs/decisions/turn_08_product_thesis_v0.md`
- `docs/product/orca_offer_hypothesis_v0.md`
- `docs/product/orca_buyer_proof_packet_v0.md`
- `docs/product/orca_product_lead_first_icp_wedge_decision_v0.md`
- `.agents/workflow-overlay/product-proof.md`

### Core Spine Evidence Standard Work

Start with:

- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_product_contract.md`
- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_information_production_foundation_v0.md`
- `docs/product/engagement_logic_registry_v0.md`
- nearest boundary or proof artifact named by the request.

### Prompt Or Review Prompt Work

Start with:

- `.agents/workflow-overlay/prompt-orchestration.md`
- `.agents/workflow-overlay/template-registry.md`
- relevant prompt template under `docs/prompts/templates/`
- the target source artifact being prompted or reviewed.

## New Thread Guidance

Use a new thread or compact handoff when the next task needs more than one
recommended read pack, more than six full artifacts, or both repo-map refresh
and CA prompt drafting. The handoff should cite this map, the source-loading
overlay, the target read pack, and the files excluded by default.

## Not-Proven Boundaries

This map does not prove acceptance, validation, readiness, buyer pull,
implementation authorization, source correctness, or freshness of every listed
artifact. Check the target artifact, retrieval header, and current `git status`
before strict claims.
