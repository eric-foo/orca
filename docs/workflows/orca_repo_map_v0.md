  - Deciding which product, prompt, review, research, or workflow files are adjacent to a task.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
open_next:
  - .agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md
  - .agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md
stale_if:
  - New top-level folders (under the repo root or docs/) are added.
  - orca-harness/ packages, adapters, runners, fixtures, or its build authorizations are added or reorganized.
  - Core Spine, Data Capture Spine, Cleaning Spine, Judgment Spine, offer, proof, or prompt families are materially reorganized.
  - Reddit CloakBrowser/proxy allowance, Candidate URL Intake, Reddit Graph Frontier Lane, or Source Capture Armory routing changes.

```

- Status: ACTIVE_RETRIEVAL_MAP (retrieval-only; source authority remains in `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md`)
- Artifact type: Workflow navigation artifact
- Scope: Repo navigation and source-pack selection
- Refreshed: 2026-06-30 (Bronze MGT baseline declaration route added: `core_spine_v0_data_lake_bronze_mgt_baseline_declaration_v0.md` records post-PR-520 Bronze as Mini God Tier / 90-95 typed raw-truth retrievability, not full God Tier, and `catalog.py` now exposes `bronze_baseline_status` on generated catalog surfaces). Prior: 2026-06-30 (Bronze Catalog AR-MGT-90 route added: `catalog.py` now generates non-authoritative Attachment Record entries under `attachment_records/` from preserved raw packet bodies, with stable `ar_` IDs, body-sha/path references, source-surface coordination paths, payload-kind/body-sha buckets, and a resolver that verifies raw manifests; no Manifest v2, body-copy store, or final AR physicalization claim). Prior: 2026-06-30 (Bronze Catalog source-surface hardening route added: `catalog.py` now emits self-describing `source_surfaces.json` coverage for observed `(source_family, source_surface)` pairs, with non-authority/non-completeness semantics, `catalog_schema_version`, stable query path hints, and explicit `registered` / `universal_only` extractor-coverage meaning).

## How To Use This Map

Use this map to choose files. Do not treat it as product authority.

For source precedence, open `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md`.
For source-loading budgets, open `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md`.
For artifact retrievability, body-opening shape, stale/recheck patterns, and
temporary-artifact anti-rot guidance, open
`docs/workflows/artifact_retrievability_guide.md`.

Start-route cue: when a task may change product doctrine, architecture
doctrine, workflow authority, validation philosophy, review authority, output
authority, or a lifecycle boundary, open the Doctrine Change Propagation
Contract in `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md` before selecting
downstream surfaces. That contract owns primary `trigger` plus
`related_triggers` grammar for multi-dimensional doctrine changes. Use this map
to identify likely downstream surfaces; do not treat the map itself as
propagation evidence.

## Active Hooks (IMPORTANT)

ORCA enforces load-bearing, mechanically-checkable rules at **tool
boundaries**, not by instruction alone. The owning principle is
`.agents/workflow-overlay/validation-gates.md` -> "Enforcement Placement"
(cross-referenced from `.agents/workflow-overlay/decision-routing.md`); the per-rule classification is
`docs/decisions/overlay_enforcement_placement_classification_v0.md`.

**Retrieval-header check.** A PostToolUse hook (matcher `Write|Edit|MultiEdit`) in the
tracked `.claude/settings.json` runs:

```
python .agents/hooks/check_retrieval_header.py --hook
```

When a newly written or edited `*.md` in a durable in-scope folder (the folders
`.agents/workflow-overlay/retrieval-metadata.md` enumerates) is missing its
retrieval header, the hook returns a non-blocking advisory warning. It is
forward-only (only the file just touched), advisory (never blocks the edit),
and references the rule authority rather than restating it.

**Portable CLI / commit / CI backstop** (runs outside Claude Code too):

```
# advisory (exit 0): warn on any changed in-scope file missing its header
python  .agents/hooks/check_retrieval_header.py --changed          # Windows
python3 .agents/hooks/check_retrieval_header.py --changed          # POSIX
# strict gate (exit 1 on violation): for a pre-commit hook or CI
python3 .agents/hooks/check_retrieval_header.py --staged --strict
# explicit paths also work:
python3 .agents/hooks/check_retrieval_header.py path/to/artifact.md
```

**Reinstall (fresh clone, or if local settings were reset).** The checker
script is tracked at `.agents/hooks/check_retrieval_header.py`. The hook lives
in the tracked `.claude/settings.json`; if it is missing (for example only
present in a gitignored `.claude/settings.local.json`, or settings were reset),
re-add:

```json
"hooks": {
  "PostToolUse": [
    { "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
      "hooks": [ { "type": "command",
                   "command": "python .agents/hooks/check_retrieval_header.py --hook",
                   "timeout": 10 } ] } ]
}
```

Hooks load at session start, so **restart the Claude Code session** after
editing settings. The command uses a path relative to the project root (where
Claude Code runs hooks); if your environment runs hooks from another directory,
use an absolute path or `"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.agents/hooks/check_retrieval_header.py"`.
On POSIX, use `python3` if `python` is unavailable.

**Repo-map freshness check.** A second PostToolUse hook (matcher
`Write|Edit|MultiEdit` in `.claude/settings.json`; `apply_patch|Edit|Write` in
`.codex/hooks.json`) runs:

```
python .agents/hooks/check_repo_map_freshness.py --hook
```

It reads THIS map as its own spec and, forward-only on the file just touched,
emits a non-blocking advisory when an edit adds navigable structure this map
does not yet cover -- the mechanically-detectable subset of the `stale_if:` block
above: a new top-level area (#1) or a new `orca-harness/` runner/adapter (#2).
When the file just touched IS this repo map and Git still shows it dirty after
the edit, the hook exits 2 as a blocking commit interrupt with the explicit-path
commit command. Edits to `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md` get a
coarser advisory nudge (#5). It stays silent
on ordinary content in already-mapped folders (a new `docs/decisions/*` is
reachable by convention, not a map event) and cannot see judgment-shaped
staleness -- "a spine was reorganized" (#3) or "routing doctrine changed" (#4) --
which stays with the Doctrine Change Propagation contract in
`.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md` (which already lists this map as a
downstream surface).

**Portable CLI / commit / CI backstop** (runs outside Claude Code too):

```
# advisory (exit 0): report structural drift in the working tree
python  .agents/hooks/check_repo_map_freshness.py --changed          # Windows
python3 .agents/hooks/check_repo_map_freshness.py --changed          # POSIX
# strict gate (exit 1): block a commit that adds new structure without
# updating this map / a submap and without an acknowledgment
python .agents/hooks/check_repo_map_freshness.py --commit-msg "$1"   # commit-msg hook
python3 .agents/hooks/check_repo_map_freshness.py --changed --strict --message "$PR_BODY"  # CI
python .agents/hooks/check_repo_map_freshness.py --selftest          # self-check logic
```

To acknowledge a legitimate non-map change so the strict gate passes: for a
one-off, put `repo-map-ack: <reason>` in the commit message; for a recurring
class (generated scratch), add a backtick'd token to the "Generated/gitignored
scratch ... do not enumerate" list (this checker reads that list as its exclusion
source). Updating this map or a submap in the same change also satisfies the
gate. The check enforces map *shape*, never the truth of a route, and fails OPEN
on internal error. Reinstall = re-add the second PostToolUse entry beside the
retrieval-header hook in `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json`, then
restart the relevant session.

**Placement check (EP-04) — built and wired.** A third substrate,
`.agents/hooks/check_placement.py`, enforces placement shape at the write
boundary: it reads `repo-structure.yaml` as its ONLY rule source (authority
stays in `.agents/workflow-overlay/artifact-folders.md`; binding in
`docs/decisions/orca_repo_structure_binding_v0.md`), WARNs on unplaced writes,
flags writes to the now-retired product-docs role, and
checks map<->tree consistency in both directions. `_inbox` age and declared legacy
debt are WARN-only. A pass is placement shape only — never validation,
readiness, or authority.

```
python .agents/hooks/check_placement.py --check      # advisory tree report (exit 0)
python .agents/hooks/check_placement.py --strict     # commit/CI gate (exit 1 on violation or stale map)
python .agents/hooks/check_placement.py --selftest   # decision-logic self-check
```

WIRED as a PostToolUse (`Write|Edit|MultiEdit`) entry in `.claude/settings.json`,
beside the other PostToolUse hooks. Reinstall (if settings were reset) = re-add
`{ "type": "command", "command": "python .agents/hooks/check_placement.py --hook", "timeout": 10 }`
to the PostToolUse array, then restart the session (hooks load at session start).

**Prompt-preflight reminder (advisory).** A PostToolUse hook (matcher
`Write|Edit|MultiEdit` in `.claude/settings.json`,
`python .agents/hooks/check_prompt_provenance.py --hook`): after a write under
`docs/prompts/**`, injects the **Orca Prompt Preflight** (output mode · template
kind · edit-permission+targets+branch · reviews findings-first + no runtime-model
routing · doctrine-change -> propagation receipt · destinations) so a routine
prompt applies the contract inline with no skill reload; fused /
delegated-review-patch / novel prompts still author through
`workflow-prompt-orchestrator` (rule owned by
`.agents/workflow-overlay/prompt-orchestration.md`). Remind only, never blocks,
exit 0; it cannot verify the contract was applied (misses paste-ready chat
prompts that never touch disk -- named limitation).
`python .agents/hooks/check_prompt_provenance.py --selftest` checks the decision
logic.

**SCI reminder (advisory).** A PreToolUse hook (matcher `Bash|PowerShell`
in `.claude/settings.json`, gated to `git commit`) runs:

```
python .agents/hooks/remind_sci.py --hook
```

RIGHT BEFORE a `git commit` (run through the Bash/PowerShell tool) that has durable-artifact changes pending (the same durable-artifact
folder set the retrieval-header hook uses -- decisions, product, prompts,
workflows, migration, hygiene, review-inputs/outputs, the workflow overlay, and
the product corpus; scratch, inbox, skill copies, project config, and code are
excluded), it injects the Smallest Complete Intervention rule as non-blocking
`additionalContext`. The rule is OWNED by `AGENTS.md`; the hook carries that
section's text INLINE as a verbatim mirror (no fetch round-trip) and must be kept
in sync with it. Forward-only, advisory, fails open.
`python .agents/hooks/remind_sci.py --selftest` checks the scope logic. Reinstall
= re-add the PreToolUse entry (matcher `Bash|PowerShell`) in
`.claude/settings.json`, then restart the session.

**Permission floor (protected paths + git lifecycle).** A second
enforcement-placement substrate (EP-01 + EP-03 in
`docs/decisions/overlay_enforcement_placement_classification_v0.md`), built as
Claude Code `permissions` rules — no script:

- **`ask` — git lifecycle, shared/tracked in `.claude/settings.json`:**
  `git push`, `git remote`, `gh pr`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, for both
  the `Bash` and `PowerShell` tools (`git commit` is in `allow` — auto-approved,
  not prompted). Claude Code prompts for
  explicit approval; the approval is the authorization (`.agents/workflow-overlay/safety-rules.md`
  "...unless explicitly authorized"). Travels with the repo.
- **`deny` — protected paths, machine-local in `.claude/settings.local.json`:**
  writes/edits to external / installed-skill roots — `agent-workflow`, `jb*`,
  `~/.codex/{plugins,skills}`, `~/.claude/{plugins,skills}`, `~/.agents/skills`.
  Hard-blocked. Machine-specific absolute paths, so NOT tracked; a fresh clone
  re-adds its own external paths.
- Authority: `.agents/workflow-overlay/safety-rules.md` (the rules) + validation-gates "Enforcement
  Placement" (the placement principle). Config enforces existing rules; it
  changes no doctrine. EP-02 (impl-dir blocking) was deliberately excluded.
- Limits: Claude-Code-only (Codex unaffected — the resident instruction stays);
  `deny` is machine-local; restart the session to load; not a security boundary.

**Reinstall the permission floor (fresh clone, or if local settings were
reset).** The `ask` git-lifecycle rules live in the tracked
`.claude/settings.json`; the `deny` path rules live in the gitignored
`.claude/settings.local.json`, so a clone does NOT recover them — re-add both
(adjust the absolute paths to the local machine). In `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
"permissions": {
  "allow": [
    "Bash(git commit*)", "PowerShell(git commit*)"
  ],
  "ask": [
    "Bash(git push*)", "PowerShell(git push*)",
    "Bash(git remote*)", "PowerShell(git remote*)",
    "Bash(gh pr*)", "PowerShell(gh pr*)",
    "Bash(git reset --hard*)", "PowerShell(git reset --hard*)",
    "Bash(git clean*)", "PowerShell(git clean*)"
  ]
}
```

In `.claude/settings.local.json` (machine-specific absolute paths):

```json
"permissions": {
  "deny": [
    "Edit(//c/Users/vmon7/Desktop/projects/agent-workflow/**)", "Write(//c/Users/vmon7/Desktop/projects/agent-workflow/**)",
    "Edit(//c/Users/vmon7/Desktop/projects/jb*/**)", "Write(//c/Users/vmon7/Desktop/projects/jb*/**)",
    "Edit(//c/Users/vmon7/.codex/plugins/**)", "Write(//c/Users/vmon7/.codex/plugins/**)",
    "Edit(//c/Users/vmon7/.codex/skills/**)", "Write(//c/Users/vmon7/.codex/skills/**)",
    "Edit(//c/Users/vmon7/.claude/plugins/**)", "Write(//c/Users/vmon7/.claude/plugins/**)",
    "Edit(//c/Users/vmon7/.claude/skills/**)", "Write(//c/Users/vmon7/.claude/skills/**)",
    "Edit(//c/Users/vmon7/.agents/skills/**)", "Write(//c/Users/vmon7/.agents/skills/**)"
  ]
}
```

Restart the Claude Code session after editing settings.

**Protected-action guard (PreToolUse) — the auto-mode enforcement.** The `ask`
config rules above are inert in auto / bypass mode (no human to prompt), so the
real enforcement of EP-01 + EP-03 is a `PreToolUse` hook that fires in ALL
permission modes:

- script: `.agents/hooks/guard_protected_actions.py` (tracked); matcher
  `Bash|PowerShell|Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit` in `.claude/settings.json`.
- blocks (exit 2): writes/edits into protected roots (`agent-workflow`, `jb*`,
  `~/.codex/{plugins,skills}`, `~/.claude/{plugins,skills}`, `~/.agents/skills`);
  and main-affecting git — landing a PR to `main` (`gh pr merge`), push to
  `main`, force-push, bare/ambiguous push — plus `reset --hard` / `clean`, via
  Bash or PowerShell. **Allows** an explicit non-main, non-force lane push
  (`git push -u origin <lane>`) so lanes prep PRs (per-lane PR flow in
  `docs/decisions/dev_workflow_ci_branch_protection_doctrine_v0.md`); a
  human/authorized action lands the PR to `main`. Narrow: `commit`, generic
  deletion, and *mentions* of these in quoted strings are NOT blocked.
- references authority (`.agents/workflow-overlay/safety-rules.md`), fails OPEN on internal error, and has
  a selftest: `python .agents/hooks/guard_protected_actions.py --selftest`.
- authorized exception: run the action yourself, or temporarily remove the hook.

Reinstall the PreToolUse guard in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
"hooks": {
  "PreToolUse": [
    { "matcher": "Bash|PowerShell|Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit",
      "hooks": [ { "type": "command",
                   "command": "python .agents/hooks/guard_protected_actions.py",
                   "timeout": 10 } ] } ]
}
```

Restart the Claude Code session after editing settings.

**Repo-map commit interrupt + Stop-warn backstop.** Two complementary
substrates for the high-contention commit-once-whole shared files
(the repo map, `.claude/settings.json`, `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md`):

- **Per-edit (PostToolUse).** The repo-map-freshness hook
  (`.agents/hooks/check_repo_map_freshness.py`) exits 2 when the edited file IS
  the repo map and Git still shows it dirty after the edit. The interrupt tells
  the agent to commit it immediately, explicit-path
  (`git commit --only -- docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md`), before other
  lanes' edits interleave. Distinct from its structural/freshness trigger
  (which fires on OTHER files adding navigation and remains advisory unless run
  in strict commit/CI mode).
- **Turn-end (Stop).** `.agents/hooks/check_shared_files_dirty.py` (a `Stop` hook, no matcher)
  warns when any of the three shared files is left dirty at end of turn, listing
  them plus the explicit-path commit. Exit 0, never blocks, never auto-commits
  (unsafe on a shared branch), guards `stop_hook_active`, fails open. CLI:
  `--check` (live tree), `--selftest` (logic). A second `Stop` hook,
  `.agents/hooks/check_token_burn.py`, warns (advisory, exit 0) when one turn's
  input context crosses a rung (200k warn / 500k alarm) — the quadratic-burn
  leading indicator. Reinstall = re-add both `Stop` hooks in
  `.claude/settings.json`, then restart the session.

These put the "edit the repo map -> commit it immediately, explicit-path" norm on
the substrate, not a heavy resident banner. The per-edit repo-map interrupt
blocks; the Stop backstop only warns. Neither auto-commits.

**Session-start lane capsule (SessionStart).** `.agents/hooks/session_context_capsule.py --hook`
(a `SessionStart` hook in `.claude/settings.json`; fires on startup/resume/clear/compact)
prints a compact, report-only lane-state capsule — repo root, branch, HEAD, last 3 commit
subjects, dirty/untracked counts, config-surface dirt, doctrine state vs last-fetched
`origin/main`, and pointers to the two source-loading entry artifacts (this map and the
overlay README) — so a new or re-oriented lane does not re-derive mechanical state turn by
turn. Observed git state only; loads no doctrine, asserts nothing beyond git output; exit 0,
fails open. Reinstall = re-add the `SessionStart` entry, then restart the session.

**CSB-first scanning artifact checker (portable + CI diff-scoped).** `.agents/hooks/check_csb_scanning_artifact.py`
checks future CSB-first scanning artifacts for minimum reviewable receipt shape:
source context, caps, broad-scout accounting, CSB-row accountability, exact-query
accounting, venue/hidden-venue accounting, observations, negatives/access notes,
capture-request accounting, candidate closeout, and obvious recency/Capture
overclaim leakage. CI runs `--diff origin/main --strict` forward-only over changed
`docs/research/` artifacts that look like CSB-first scan outputs; explicit paths
remain available when producing or reviewing a CSB-first scan artifact. It is not
wired as an automatic PostToolUse hook. Fixtures live under
`orca-harness/tests/fixtures/csb_scanning_artifacts/`; focused tests live at
`orca-harness/tests/unit/test_csb_scanning_artifact_validator.py`. A pass is
receipt-shape only, never scan-quality validation, buyer proof, candidate
approval, or Capture route authorization.

**Doctrine-change receipt-shape gate (EP-09) + retrieval-header forbidden-field
scan (EP-07).** Two further substrates built under owner authorization, following
this pattern:

- `.agents/hooks/check_dcp_receipt.py` — diff-scoped, forward-only CI gate
  (registered in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, a sibling to the deletion-evidence
  gate): validates the SHAPE of any real `direction_change_propagation` receipt
  or `direction_change_propagation_blocker` in changed `.md` files — required
  keys, `trigger`/`related_triggers` drawn only from the seven controlled trigger
  values, `non_claims` non-empty — referencing `source-of-truth.md` (Doctrine
  Change Propagation Contract). It skips contract templates and non-receipt
  note-markers, never requires a receipt to be *present* (doctrine-ness is
  judgment), and never asserts a listed surface was truly updated/checked. The
  inline-cap / archive-pointer / no-standalone rules are intentionally not gated
  (not born-green). `--audit` = whole-repo advisory backlog; `--selftest` present.
- `.agents/hooks/check_retrieval_header.py` — its shared predicate
  (`header_problems_for_lines`) now also rejects status-leak header keys
  (approval / validation / readiness / lifecycle / deployment / install /
  resolver / publication / source-of-truth), flowing through both the write-time
  `--hook` and the `header_index.py --strict` CI gate. Born-green;
  `edit_permission` / `verdict` / `status` are intentionally allowed (review and
  prompt frontmatter use them). `--selftest` present.

Both enforce shape, never truth; a clean run is not validation, readiness, or
approval.

**Future agents: reuse this pattern.** To enforce the next load-bearing,
deterministically-checkable rule, do not add another instruction -- add a
sibling checker under `.agents/hooks/` that references the rule's authority
(never restates it), advisory + forward-only with a `--strict` gate, wire a
PostToolUse hook the same way, and document it here. See
`.agents/workflow-overlay/validation-gates.md` -> "Enforcement Placement".

This note is navigation and discoverability only; the hook and checker are
advisory tooling, not validation, readiness, or source-of-truth promotion.

## Reddit CloakBrowser / Proxy Allowance Quick Route

If a new CA is deciding whether bounded pre-commercial Reddit work may use
CloakBrowser, anti-blocking, residential/rotating proxies, or old Reddit HTML,
do not block by default. Open these in order:

| Question | Open |
| --- | --- |
| Is CloakBrowser/proxy-backed Reddit access allowed at all? | `docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_access_tooling_build_authorization_v0.md` |
| What is the Reddit-specific capture/intake route? | `docs/workflows/data_capture_spine_consolidation_map_v0.md` |
| Is this Candidate URL Intake rather than Armory capture? | `orca/product/spines/capture/core/contracts/candidate_intake/data_capture_spine_candidate_url_intake_contract_v0.md`, then `orca/product/spines/capture/core/contracts/candidate_intake/data_capture_spine_reddit_candidate_url_intake_crawler_architecture_v0.md` |
| Is bounded graph/frontier scouting accepted? | `orca/product/spines/scanning/source_families/reddit/data_capture_spine_reddit_graph_frontier_lane_architecture_v0.md` |
| How should old Reddit search/listing HTML be saved, parsed, and interpreted? | `docs/workflows/reddit_candidate_intake_old_reddit_search_surface_handling_v0.md` |
| What are the proxy and anti-blocking hard stops? | `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/reddit_precommercial_capture_consolidation_success_signal_architecture_v0.md` |
| What is implemented now? | `docs/workflows/screening_read_service_build_receipt_v0.md`, `docs/workflows/screening_read_reusable_findings_v0.md`, `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/README.md`, then `orca-harness/README.md` and the named runner/adapter files |

Current map-level summary: CloakBrowser is the approved primary anti-blocking
route for bounded pre-commercial Reddit capture, and residential/rotating
proxies are not blanket stop conditions inside that pre-commercial/free
anti-blocking posture. Candidate URL Intake may record this approved downstream
route, but it does not invoke CloakBrowser, configure proxies, emit Source
Capture Packets, fetch bodies/comments/profiles, auto-promote URLs, or authorize
broad crawling, storage, scheduler/dashboard, deployment, production runtime,
commercial fetch, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, fixture admission, or source-quality
scoring. For no-live operator-supplied old Reddit HTML pilots, open
`docs/workflows/reddit_candidate_intake_old_reddit_search_surface_handling_v0.md`
before interpreting empty results, `search-title` anchors, raw HTML input
hygiene, or candidate-subreddit discovery with visible volume.

For screening posture, the capture-harness service is now wired on the PR branch:
`source_capture.screening_read.screening_read(...)` covers bounded public
Reddit/direct/anti-block HTTP reads, while
`source_capture.screening_browser_read.screening_browser_read(...)` covers public
browser/interstitial reads and returns visible text only. These are
orchestrator-invoked, not walker-direct; no packet, manifest, ECR, Cleaning, or
Judgment output.
For same-shaped listing pages, reuse `StructuredListingExtractionSpec` and the
row-local locator/range-sanity pattern in
`docs/workflows/screening_read_reusable_findings_v0.md`.

Reddit Candidate URL Intake is also the bounded first-contact sourcing path for
declared Reddit source surfaces when a run envelope and live access
authorization are supplied. The implemented runner is
`orca-harness/runners/run_reddit_candidate_intake_live.py`; it writes candidate
rows, provenance, and a live-run receipt only.

Reddit Graph Frontier is accepted only as a bounded planning lane with a Graph
Frontier Register. It may choose the next candidate seed and prepare a fresh
bounded run, but it does not authorize same-run traversal, Graph Frontier-owned
live Reddit fetch, automatic capture, broad crawling, Source Capture, Data
Capture, storage, scheduler, dashboard, or production runtime. Operator-facing
nickname: "crawling graph." The runner is
`orca-harness/runners/run_reddit_graph_frontier_register.py`.

| `orca/product/spines/capture/` | Capture (acquisition-side) spine: `core/` reusable acquisition layer containing source-access/candidate/corpus/obligation contracts, operating_model, packet_schema, Source Capture Toolbox, demand_durability_indicators, and source_families (`retail_pdp`, `social_media/{instagram,tiktok,youtube}`, plus the social-media-level creator public-handle linkage spec/current profile view spec and the YouTube creator-observation ledger spec/static seed). Dense - open the Data Capture submap. |
| `orca/product/spines/creator_signal/` | Creator Signal product/signal spine (promotion-bound 2026-06-28). Owns product-facing creator intelligence surfaces: profile IA, aggregate influence display, ideal/content-fit audience display, freshness, limitations, and source drill-back over Capture-owned creator records. Binding: `docs/decisions/orca_creator_signal_spine_promotion_binding_v0.md`. |

## Orca Harness

`orca-harness/` is bounded, authorized implementation backing Data Capture
source acquisition and the v0.14 Judgment Harness. It is navigation context
here, not a runtime, acceptance, or readiness claim. Build scope is controlled
by the authorization decisions named below; surfaces outside them (production
runtime, commercial fetch, broad crawling, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment
design) remain gated.

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `orca-harness/capture_spine/` | Capture-spine planning/validation/materialization helpers: Reddit Graph Frontier, LinkedIn lane/frontier validators, `creator_public_handle_linkage/` for the static public-handle linkage ledger validator, `youtube_creator_observation/` for the YouTube creator observation ledger rebuild/live-lake verifier, and `creator_profile_current/` for deriving the checked-in creator-profile-current view from sibling account-linkage and metric-seed ledgers. Navigation context only; not live capture, runtime readiness, SQLite adoption, person identity proof, or a claim that all future metric rollups are source-backed. |
| `orca-harness/source_capture/` | Source-capture packet core: models, writer, CLI support, plaintext receipts, bounded mechanical projection helpers including Fragrantica current-window projection (`fragrantica_projection.py`), the no-network fragrance purchase-review focused coverage helper (`fragrance_review_coverage.py`; saved widget/PDP files only, selected reader bodies plus skipped metadata/hashes), the rendered+widget fragrance purchase-review capture helper (`fragrance_rendered_widget_companion.py`; PDP above-fold render plus passive widget response preservation, optional bounded widget fallback URL completion, emits the focused coverage subreceipt; not ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment), the `block_shell` honest-success classifier (block-shell / empty / content-unverified; no positive content class), the bounded Reddit screening-read entry `screening_reddit_read.py` (entitlement-gated, screen-light, adapter-not-runner: wires `fetch_direct_http_capture` only, never the packet/ECR runner; returns a screen-light record, no disk artifact / no ECR), the cross-archive historical-capture LOCATE orchestrator `historical_capture.py` (slice E: ordered Wayback -> archive.today -> publisher-history ladder above the adapters; stops at the first verified pre-cutoff body; neutral `archives_tried`/`archive_selected` facts, INV-1), and `lane_orchestration.py` for shared vertical lane receipts (status/message/outputs/residuals only; no acquisition-method standardization). |
| `orca-harness/data_lake/` | Data Lake filesystem root and generated-index helpers: v4.1 sharded raw/derived/ack layout, availability index rebuilds, verified raw-packet reads, and Bronze Catalog v0 (`catalog.py`), which rebuilds non-authoritative retrieval indexes from committed raw packet manifests under `indexes/derived_retrieval/bronze_catalog/v0` with universal packet facets, source-family extractors such as IG reels-grid creator/shortcode facets, self-describing `source_surfaces.json` coverage that marks observed lanes as `registered` or `universal_only` without implying completeness/readiness, generated `attachment_records/` entries over preserved raw body files with stable record IDs, body-sha/path references, source-surface/payload/body-sha buckets, resolver-verified byte reads, an inspect-only Bronze coverage census over observed source-family/source-surface + Attachment Record counts, and additive `bronze_baseline_status` markers that expose the post-PR-525 MGT baseline without claiming full GT. Retrieval coverage only; not Manifest v2, a body-copy store, a capture-lane registry, Silver readiness, or final Attachment Record physicalization. |
| `orca-harness/source_capture/youtube_watch_packet.py` | Network-free SourceCapturePacket writer for YouTube watch-page metadata/comments capture; stores raw watch HTML, youtubei next page JSON, explicit availability/comment states, metric observations, and preserved route receipts. |
| `orca-harness/source_capture/adapters/` | Bounded capture adapters (direct HTTP, media/asset, Archive.org, archive.today (`archive_today`: Memento TimeMap locate+body rung, served-time verification, no-gate-defeat STOP on a challenge), browser snapshot, authenticated browser, Reddit API where present, fragrance widget fallback transport (`fragrance_widget_fallback.py`; bounded widget URL fetches for the rendered companion only), and a header-complete anti-blocking HTTP rung-1 adapter `anti_blocking_http`). CloakBrowser Snapshot anonymous non-persistent v0 now has a live engine and packet runner for one explicitly supplied URL; verify any adapter's presence in code before use. Reddit discovery/consolidation, proxy/session behavior, commercial fetch, broad crawling, storage, dashboards, deployment, and production runtime remain separately gated. |
| `orca-harness/source_capture/transcript/` | Cross-source transcript ACQUISITION (Capture layer): per-platform fetchers returning RAW artifacts + capture metadata for SourceCapturePacket staging (`youtube_captions.py`: YouTube captions via yt-dlp default token-free client; `caption_packet.py`: network-free packet builder; `audio_asr.py` + `asr_packet.py`: VAD-gated faster-whisper ASR fallback when captions are absent, writing the transcript as a `transcript_asr` derived record keyed to the audio packet; `ig_reels_audio_packet.py`: the Instagram-Reels analogue — anonymous yt-dlp bestaudio fetch + IG audio/`transcript_asr` writer (`source_family=instagram_creator`, `source_surface=ig_reels_audio`; Reels have no caption API so ASR is the only route; audience-restricted = typed skip; spec under `…/source_families/social_media/instagram/`)). The readable/clean transcript is a downstream Cleaning transform. Navigation context only; not Cleaning, Judgment, or readiness. |
| `orca-harness/source_observability/` | Local operator-record posture checker and limitation reporter. |
| `orca-harness/ecr/` | Evidence Candidate Record source-side integrity postures (SP-1/2/3/6): per-packet/slice derived records keyed to the `SourceCapturePacket`; bind no `EvidenceUnit`; JSG-01 frozen. Boundary context: `orca/product/spines/foundation/product_contract/core_spine_v0_data_and_cleaning_spine_boundary_v0.md`. |
| `orca-harness/signal_content/` | Signal Content Record (v0): retained compatibility/history code for the deprecated/dormant content contract; not default pre-Judgment generation. Direction + deprecation posture: `orca/product/spines/ecr/signal_content/core_spine_v0_signal_content_record_architecture_v0.md`. |
| `orca-harness/evidence_binding/` | JSG-01-scoped EvidenceUnit binding (owner-ratified 2026-06-12): the three-key `Jsg01EvidenceBinding` + the pure `compose_jsg01_evidence_record` composer + verifier; references packet/ECR/receipt by key, binds no posture/value, computes no aggregate verdict. Design basis: `orca/product/spines/ecr/evidence_candidate_record/ecr_consolidation_v0_jsg01_evidence_unit_binding_slice_plan_v0.md`. Navigation context only; not a JSG-01 unfreeze, validation, or readiness. |
| `orca-harness/cleaning/` | Bounded local Cleaning-layer code (models, core, projection, source-family adapters/lake writers including Fragrantica projection→Cleaning and append-only Cleaning derived records) and the YouTube transcript→product Pass-1 LLM lane (`transcript_product_extractor.py`: mention extraction with the CE5/CE9 quote-locator — the model gives a quote, code locates it in the cues to both verify it and assign the timestamp; `transcript_product_lake.py`: silver mentions persist + timing-preserving json3→cues). Navigation context only — not the gated production Cleaning lane, acceptance, or readiness. |
| `orca-harness/schemas/` | Pydantic v2 models for cases, judgments, scoring, and probes (v0.14), plus the YouTube transcript→product extraction models (`product_mention_models.py`: `ProductMention` / `StatedRating`, finite-guarded floats, verdict-free by construction). |
| `orca-harness/scoring/` | Deterministic, LLM-free scoring: the v0.14 band scorer + mapping table, the Pass-2 product-verdict fusion `product_fusion.py` — per-product creator verdict via a tunable, documented `FusionConfig` knob set — its calibration sensitivity harness `product_fusion_sensitivity.py`, and the sibling `audience_fusion.py`. The fusion's UNCALIBRATED v0 calibration surface + findings: `docs/decisions/product_verdict_fusion_calibration_surface_v0.md`; the corpus procedure: `docs/workflows/product_verdict_calibration_labeling_protocol_v0.md`, whose blind answer-key machinery (Phase B labeling worklist + label loader) is `calibration_corpus.py`; the Pass-1 note-adjective stance rubric (0.1→0.4) fix is blind-validated (non-circular re-extraction): methodology + per-product audit table in `docs/decisions/pass1_actionable_stance_calibration_v0.md`, summary record in `docs/decisions/product_verdict_pass1_note_stance_calibration_validation_v0.md`. Not judgment-quality proof. |
| `orca-harness/reports/` | Report-rendering code (case and source-observability reports); generated dry-run outputs under it are gitignored. |
| `orca-harness/runners/` | CLI entrypoints for case runs, memorization probe, bounded Candidate URL Intake live first-contact sourcing, Reddit Graph Frontier / crawling graph register preparation, source-capture packets (incl. the cross-archive `run_source_capture_historical_packet.py`, which runs the slice-E locate ladder and writes the selected rung's body plus a thin `archive_locate_metadata.json` ladder receipt), IG public creator capture (`run_source_capture_ig_reels_grid_packet.py` is the optimized `/reels/` grid default; `run_source_capture_ig_calls_packet.py` is legacy item-page fallback), the locked-list IG calls batch circuit guard `run_source_capture_ig_calls_batch.py` (wraps the per-profile IG calls packet runner, stops/cooldowns on circuit-break signals, no source discovery or comment capture), offline projection materialization such as `run_ig_creator_momentum_projection.py` and `run_ig_reels_grid_projection.py` (projects existing IG `/reels/` grid packets or appends by-key lake-derived records), Fragrantica Mini God Tier anonymous capture (`run_fragrantica_mgt_capture.py`: direct HTTP + initial viewport + bounded deep-scroll packets with a local bundle summary; no login/archive/projection/ECR/Cleaning claim), Fragrantica current-window packet projection (`run_fragrantica_projection.py`), creator-profile-current materialization/checking (`run_creator_profile_current_materialize.py`: deterministic account-ledger + metric-seed -> checked-in creator profile view, with `--check` for staleness and `--write` for refresh), local Retail/PDP packet-directory projection (`run_retail_pdp_projection.py`; no capture, ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment), the no-network fragrance purchase-review focused coverage runner (`run_fragrance_review_coverage.py`; saved widget/PDP files only, selected reader bodies plus skipped metadata/hashes; no capture, ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment), the rendered+widget fragrance purchase-review capture runner (`run_fragrance_rendered_widget_companion.py`; one PDP render plus same-load widget response preservation, optional bounded widget fallback URLs in the same operator command; emits a rendered companion plus focused review coverage subreceipt; not ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment), the opt-in Retail/PDP CloakBrowser projection sidecar (`run_source_capture_cloakbrowser_packet.py --source-family retail_pdp --retail-pdp-projection-output <path>`), the no-network Capture/ECR/Cleaning smoke stitcher (`run_capture_ecr_cleaning_smoke.py`; consumes existing packet/projection/consolidation artifacts only), the no-network Cleaning periodic audit runner (`run_cleaning_spine_periodic_audit.py`; consumes frozen smoke manifests plus existing packet/projection/ECR/Cleaning outputs and classifies capture preflight, projection, and Cleaning breakpoints without scheduling or live capture), the daemon-ready YouTube transcript product extraction runner `run_transcript_product_extract.py` (idempotent scan of committed transcripts → silver product-mentions lake lane; injected transport, offline-testable), the Instagram-Reels transcript lane (`run_source_capture_ig_reels_audio_packet.py`: anonymous yt-dlp bestaudio capture + ASR `transcript_asr` write, `access_gated` typed skip for audience-restricted Reels; `run_ig_reels_product_extract.py`: the daemon-ready IG analogue discovering `instagram_creator`/`ig_reels_audio` packets → silver product-mentions; `run_source_capture_ig_reels_deep_capture.py`: the ONE-render reel deep-capture deriving BOTH audience comments and the creator transcript from a single anonymous browser render, collapsing the comments+audio double-fetch; `run_source_capture_ig_reels_creator_deep_capture.py`: scans a creator's `/reels/` grid, ranks reels by engagement, and deep-captures + persists the top-N via the silver lake adapter `source_capture/ig_reels_deep_capture_lake.py`; `run_ig_reels_operator_product_extract.py`: exports/imports operator Codex-assisted strict-JSON product extraction packets into the same silver product-mentions lane; `run_ig_reels_lane_orchestrator.py`: sequences requested IG grid, deep-capture, operator-product, and projection lanes with shared receipts and no YouTube/TikTok acquisition coupling), and source-observability reports. Retail/PDP binding/residual implementation lives in `orca-harness/source_capture/retail_pdp_projection.py`. The runners named here are illustrative, not exhaustive; enumerate with `git ls-files orca-harness/runners/*.py`. |
| `orca-harness/runners/run_source_capture_youtube_watch_packet.py` | CLI entrypoint for YouTube watch-page metadata/comments SourceCapturePacket writes; wraps the incumbent watch fetcher, supports data-lake mode, preserves availability states and metric route receipts, and makes no transcript/Cleaning/Judgment claim. |
| `orca-harness/runners/run_data_lake_doctor.py` | CLI entrypoint for v4.1 Data Lake operator inspection: verifies root/epoch context through `DataLakeRoot.resolve`, reports raw packet counts, availability-index gaps/staleness/orphans, wrong-shard or legacy-flat raw packets, read/hash failures, and unexpected top-level folders; writes only when `--rebuild-availability` is explicitly set. |
| `orca-harness/runners/run_data_lake_catalog.py` | CLI entrypoint for the generated Bronze Catalog v0: inspect-only by default, `--census` emits a read-only observed Bronze source-surface / Attachment Record coverage census, nonzero on missing/stale/orphaned generated catalog files, reports self-describing source-surface and generated Attachment Record coverage, and replaces `indexes/derived_retrieval/bronze_catalog/v0` from verified raw packets only when `--rebuild` is explicitly set. |
| `orca-harness/cases/` | Tracked deterministic fixture case(s) (e.g. TR/Casetext v0.14) with evidence, packet, and ledger; generated `scores/` and run outputs are gitignored. |
| `orca-harness/config/` | Static YAML config (contestants, models, prompts) consumed by runners. |
| `orca-harness/docs/` | Harness operating docs: source-capture packet and agent runbook, source-observability record guide, and scalability note. |
| `orca-harness/tests/` | `unit/`, `contract/`, and `integration/` tests plus fixtures, including no-LLM-import, no-tools contract guards, Fragrantica projection/Cleaning/lake tests, data-lake doctor inspection tests, Bronze Catalog rebuild/inspect/stale/orphan tests, Commission Signal Board validator fixtures, CSB-first scanning artifact checker fixtures, and creator public-handle linkage synthetic/adversarial fixtures. |
| `orca-harness/harness_utils.py`, `orca-harness/Makefile`, `orca-harness/pyproject.toml` | Shared utilities, dev shortcuts, and package metadata (optional `[browser]` Playwright extra). |

Controlling build authority:
`docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_access_tooling_build_authorization_v0.md`
(source-capture armory) and
`docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_observability_local_support_implementation_execution_authorization_v0.md`
(local source-observability support).

Generated/gitignored scratch — do not enumerate or treat as authoritative:
`orca-harness/_test_runs/` (scratch; does not exist yet on a fresh clone), `_auth_state/`, `pytest_*` temp dirs,
`reports/source_observability/*_dry_run.*`, `cases/*/*/scores/`, and
`memory/logs/`.

## Product Anchor Files

Use these before broad product architecture or CA setup:

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/decisions/orca_product_thesis_consumer_demand_v0.md` | Orca thesis (consumer-demand decision intelligence, beauty first; owner-ratified 2026-06-12; supersedes `docs/decisions/turn_08_product_thesis_v0.md`), value proposition, strategic center, product boundary. |
| `orca/product/spines/product_lead/offer/orca_offer_hypothesis_v0.md` | Offer hypothesis, buyer-facing language, first proof offer, ICP boundary. |
| `orca/product/spines/product_lead/buyer_proof/orca_buyer_proof_packet_v0.md` | First buyer-proof packet, proof gates, pull signals, kill/graduation criteria. |
| `docs/decisions/orca_icp_wedge_consumer_demand_first_v0.md` | Current first-proof ICP wedge (beauty operator door; owner co-ratified 2026-06-12; supersedes pricing-first) and decision-family focus. |
| `orca/product/spines/product_lead/proof_charter/orca_product_proof_lead_charter_v0.md` | Product proof lead role and proof execution boundary. |
| `orca/product/spines/product_lead/proof_charter/orca_claim_defense_doctrine_v0.md` | Operative external-claims policy (owner-signed 2026-06-11): built-to vs proven-at, per-tier wording table, debunking triage. Read before any externally visible sentence about Orca's judgment evidence. |

## Judgment Spine

The Judgment Spine spans **both** trees — `docs/research/judgment-spine/` (thesis, manifest, cases, harness) and `orca/product/spines/judgment/`. **Open the consolidation map first**: it is the single `retrieval_only` entry that orients across both trees and routes one hop to every owner. Do not pre-load the owners from here.

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/research/judgment-spine/judgment_spine_consolidation_map_v0.md` | **Judgment Spine entry map — open first.** Per-area summary, owner-native status, and one pointer for thesis, cases/manifest, conductor, gate ownership, evidence ladder, JSG-08, harness, current decomposition, and fragrance Level 1 product-learning organizers; routes to the owners rather than restating them. Use the current-state/decomposition and fragrance Level 1 routes for backtest product-learning setup; use the conductor for the JSG run lane. Both are product-learning/not-proof unless owner gates say otherwise. |

## Data Capture Spine

The Data Capture Spine spans product authority, source-access decisions, Source
Capture Armory docs, source-quality support, and `orca-harness/` implementation.
**Open the repo submap first** for capture/armory work: it is the
`retrieval_only` entry that orients across these surfaces and routes one hop to
the owner sources. Do not pre-load all capture artifacts from this map.

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/workflows/data_capture_spine_consolidation_map_v0.md` | **Data Capture Spine repo submap — open first.** Routes to Capture obligations, source-access boundary, build authorization, method plan, Source Capture Armory README, packet lifecycle, harness runners, source-quality support, and current Reddit pre-commercial routing. Map only; not validation, readiness, source-access permission, or implementation authority. |
| `orca/product/spines/capture/core/contracts/corpus_intake/data_capture_spine_corpus_intake_obligation_contract_proposal_v0.md` | **Corpus Intake (standing-capture) obligation contract — owner-ratified 2026-06-15.** The standing sibling of the v0 commissioned obligation contract: the obligation home for recurring capture of an approved public signal into an append-only corpus before a Decision Frame. Ratified, not pressure-tested; authorizes no build, scheduler, runtime, or source access. |
| `orca/product/spines/scanning/source_families/linkedin/data_capture_spine_linkedin_lane_index_v0.md` | **LinkedIn lane entry map — open first for any LinkedIn task.** THE canonical cold-start index for LinkedIn access (no-live, planning-only): ties the authority docs + the slice-1/slice-2 harness + the hard rails + deferred work + cross-vendor review provenance. |
| `orca/product/spines/capture/core/operating_model/data_capture_spine_future_exploration_lanes_v0.md` | Capture-spine-level backlog of deferred, legally-gated capabilities (relationship-graph analytics; contact/outreach) surfaced during LinkedIn discovery design — non-authorizing, out of scope for all discovery lanes. |
| `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/source_capture_playbook_v0.md` | **Capture-investigation method (the playbook).** The repeatable "read the problem -> point to the route" method for deciding whether/how a NEW source is capturable, within entitlement, by the cheapest route. Recency/currentness can raise preservation urgency/source-drift priority without changing proof or route binding. The IG lane now records standalone anonymous `yt-dlp` empty media as a route-specific failure whose next matching route is browser-rendered deep-capture, while full durable media/video preservation remains unproven. MVP = entitlement gate (Step 0) + read + route catalog + pointer + guardrails; per-source recipe cards are a growing tail authored BY probes. Review-hardened draft (de-correlated artifact review, AR-01..AR-07 adjudicated) with a later owner risk-posture amendment (status `RISK_POSTURE_AMENDED_V0` - check the Risk Posture section before applying); non-authorizing, not validation/readiness. |
| `orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_capture_toolbox/capture_recon_index_v0.md` | Capture recon consolidation index - the per-source probe findings (forums / pricing / archive / PDF / reviews / embedded-state / social routes) the playbook distills from, incl. worktree-pending findings, IG public-web route probes, and the explicit remaining TikTok recon gap. Non-authorizing. |

## Creator Signal Spine

Creator Signal is the high-level product/signal spine for the creator intelligence
profile surface. It consumes Capture-owned identity, metric, rollup, and
ideal-audience records; it owns operator/buyer presentation and claim language.
Map only: not validation, readiness, buyer proof, runtime, storage, dashboard,
live capture, outreach, or public-directory authority.

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `orca/product/spines/creator_signal/README.md` | Creator Signal spine front-door and ownership boundary. |
| `orca/product/spines/creator_signal/creator_intelligence_profile_surface_v0.md` | Product-facing one-stop creator intelligence profile surface contract. |
| `docs/decisions/orca_creator_signal_spine_promotion_binding_v0.md` | Spine-promotion binding and DCP receipt. |

## ECR Source-Side Spine

The ECR source-side spine spans the integrity postures (ECR SP-1/2/3/6) and the
deprecated/dormant sibling content contract (Signal Content Record), their shared
deriver discipline, and the boundary to the JSG-01 conductor. **Open the repo
submap first**: it is the `retrieval_only` entry that states the cross-kind
invariants and routes one hop to every owner. Do not pre-load the ECR/SCR owner
docs from this map.

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/workflows/ecr_spine_submap_v0.md` | **ECR source-side spine repo submap — open first.** Routes to the SCR deprecation/direction + deriver plan, the ECR frame + SP-1/2/3 + SP-6 slices, the receipt-translator origin, the schema-evolution doctrine, and the built `orca-harness/ecr/` + retained `orca-harness/signal_content/` code. States the reference-never-merge / per-kind-grain / carry-or-residualize / re-derive-not-migrate / conductor-boundary invariants. Map only; not validation, readiness, ratification, a JSG-01 unfreeze, or Evidence-Unit binding. |

## Core Spine Files

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `orca/product/spines/foundation/product_contract/core_spine_v0_product_contract.md` | Core Spine product contract and eight primitives. |
| `orca/product/spines/foundation/product_contract/core_spine_v0_information_production_foundation_v0.md` | Manual information-production foundation and Evidence Unit standard. |
| `orca/product/spines/foundation/product_contract/core_spine_v0_data_and_cleaning_spine_boundary_v0.md` | Data Capture/Cleaning/Judgment boundary and Evidence Candidate Record setup context. |
| `orca/product/spines/ecr/signal_content/core_spine_v0_signal_content_record_architecture_v0.md` | Signal Content Record (v0) architecture DIRECTION + deprecation posture — retained compatibility/future-revival contract for the content object, no longer a default standalone pre-Judgment generated layer. Current default route is evidence pack -> Judgment-authored signal interpretation. Direction only; the final Evidence Unit field architecture stays owner-reserved. v0 model lives in `orca-harness/signal_content/`. |
| `orca/product/spines/cleaning/contracts/core_spine_v0_corroboration_vs_amplification_discipline_v0.md` | Proposed Core Spine design note on placing independent-corroboration vs artificial-amplification discipline across the Cleaning/Judgment boundary; proposed, not validated. |
| `docs/decisions/daimler_advisory_001_claim_tier_classification_decision_v0.md` | Daimler advisory claim-tier classification decision recording the current no-durable-evidence state, required product-learning receipt before any evidence claim, and blocked buyer-proof/judgment-quality claims. |
| `orca/product/shared/engagement_registry/engagement_logic_registry_v0.md` | Signal-use and engagement interpretation registry. |
| `orca/product/spines/foundation/product_contract/core_spine_v0_proof_protocol_v0.md` | Core proof protocol. |

| `orca/product/spines/foundation/vertical_exploration/orca_vertical_exploration_guide_v0.md` | WHERE-side vertical exploration guide (owner-adopted Shape C; renamed 2026-06-11 from the venue exploration procedure): batch-scoped walk steps, commons split, influence yield, promote-on-reuse trigger. Subordinate to the case-finder frame; amendments are dated notes. |
| `orca/product/satellites/beauty/beauty_venue_card_set_v0.md` | Beauty venue card-set (promoted 2026-06-11; the ONE maintained venue asset — 12-card hard cap, per-card review dates): read FIRST at Step 0 of any beauty/personal-care screen, fragrance included. Binding terms: `docs/decisions/beauty_venue_card_set_promotion_decision_v0.md`. |

For Data Capture / Source Capture Armory detail, open the repo submap at
`docs/workflows/data_capture_spine_consolidation_map_v0.md`; this repo map
intentionally does not duplicate the owner-doc inventory.

## Data Capture Harness Operating Model

Route Data Capture operating-model and commissioning-plan questions through the
repo submap at
`docs/workflows/data_capture_spine_consolidation_map_v0.md` first. That submap
owns the one-hop pointers to v2 operating-model architecture, owner acceptance,
obligation baseline, lane thesis, and commissioning plan. This repo map does
not duplicate that inventory.

## Method Validation And Replay Files

Use only when method-validation history, replay evidence, or case-frame locks
are directly relevant. Do not include by default in Data Capture Spine CA prompts.

Key files:

- `orca/product/case_families/product_learning/other_verticals/core_spine_v0_method_validation_replay_packet_v0.md`

- `orca/product/case_families/product_learning/other_verticals/core_spine_v0_method_validation_mv09_thomson_reuters_casetext_replay_v0.md`

## Proof-Case Discovery Files

Use for customer discovery, target selection, and proof-case candidate
discovery. (The jb-era first-proof-run set — packet preparation, run charter,
locks, packet, and the jb/bt204/sh01 slices — was scrapped in PR #303; a fresh
proof rebuilds on the discovery candidates below.)

Key files:

- `orca/product/spines/product_lead/icp_wedge/orca_discovery_batch_0_target_selection_brief_v0.md`
- `orca/product/spines/product_lead/icp_wedge/orca_discovery_batch_0_qualification_prep_sentry_clerk_v0.md`
- `orca/product/spines/product_lead/icp_wedge/orca_discovery_batch_0_candidate_context_scan_v0.md`
- `orca/product/case_families/product_learning/other_verticals/core_spine_v0_heavyweight_proof_case_discovery_charter_v0.md` (discovery-scope charter), `orca/product/case_families/product_learning/other_verticals/core_spine_v0_heavyweight_proof_case_discovery_results_v0.md` (READY_FOR_OWNER_CASE_SELECTION), and `orca/product/case_families/product_learning/other_verticals/core_spine_v0_heavyweight_proof_case_discovery_results_part_2_v0.md` (backtest candidates; proposes BT2-01 Chegg/ChatGPT) — the heavyweight proof-case discovery pass that produced the candidates the older case-selection brief was blocked on.

## Backtest Specimens

Use when the task is specifically about historical cutoff discipline or the
Unity runtime-fee specimen:

- `orca/product/case_families/product_learning/other_verticals/orca_backtest_specimen_unity_runtime_fee_source_packet_v0.md`
- `orca/product/case_families/product_learning/other_verticals/orca_backtest_specimen_memo_unity_runtime_fee_at_cutoff_v0.md`
- `orca/product/case_families/product_learning/other_verticals/orca_backtest_specimen_unity_runtime_fee_outcome_calibration_v0.md`

## Prompt Families

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/prompts/product-planning/` | Product planning prompt drafts. |
| `docs/prompts/feature-planning/` | Feature planning prompt drafts. |
| `docs/prompts/deep-thinking/` | Deep reasoning prompt drafts. |

| `docs/prompts/advisory/` | Advisory prompt family. |
| `docs/prompts/hygiene-queue/` | Drift/parking area (created on first artifact; does not exist yet); not listed as an accepted prompt-family folder in the overlay. |

A few Data Capture pressure-test prompts currently sit unfiled at the
`docs/prompts/` root rather than in a typed family folder; treat them as drift
pending hygiene triage.

## Research And Review Areas

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/research/consulting-judgment-corpus/` | Consulting-judgment corpus, prompts, lane outputs, synthesis, candidate screens, backtestability, and reject patterns. |
| `docs/research/answer_engine/aeo_capture_feasibility_probe_phase0_v0.md` | AEO Phase-0 feasibility probe evidence rehomed from the scanning product spine; use as research evidence for the answer-engine source-class spec, not as product-spine authority. |
| `docs/research/orca_discovery_candidate_scan_imaginary_authors_demand_origin_discovery_v0.md` | Fresh CSB-first Imaginary Authors discovery follow-up focused on public buyer-origin venue value, exact-query negatives, capture-preservation triage, and no-candidate closeout. |
| `docs/research/orca_discovery_candidate_scan_imaginary_authors_buyer_language_rerun_v0.md` | Bounded buyer-language rerun for the Imaginary Authors CSB-first scan; records Parfumo as a high-value public community/review venue, two low-commitment candidate entries, and a preservation-only capture_request. |
| `docs/research/orca_discovery_candidate_scan_imaginary_authors_broad_scout_deep_scan_v0.md` | Fresh CSB broad-scout plus main deep-scan artifact for Imaginary Authors; confirms Parfumo as the high-value public buyer-language venue, carries two hold-low-commitment candidate entries, and records preservation-only capture requests. |
| `docs/research/orca_discovery_candidate_scan_beauty_neutral_chatgptpro_v0.md` | Clean advisory intake of the neutral ChatGPT Pro beauty/personal-care niche answer; use before any no-contact verification scan or owner niche-selection decision. |
| `docs/research/orca_discovery_candidate_scan_food_vs_fragrance_chatgptpro_v0.md` | Advisory intake of the ChatGPT Pro food-vs-fragrance category answer; use before deciding whether to keep fragrance as the first no-contact verification scan or reopen food as a comparator category. |
| `docs/research/judgment-spine/` | Judgment Spine corpus (parent contract, manifest, case tracks, harness, case-learning). **Open the consolidation map first** — see the Judgment Spine section above; it routes to every owner across both trees instead of enumerating them here. |
| `docs/research/daimler_advisory_001_source_registry_v0.md` | Manual Daimler source-unit registry separating participant-safe candidates, date ambiguity, missing evidence, and reveal-only material before any packet rebuild or judgment-quality claim. |

| `docs/review-outputs/method-validation/` | Method-validation review outputs. |
| `docs/review-outputs/proof/` | Proof review outputs (currently a README placeholder). |

## Daimler Advisory & Probe Lane

Daimler is the selected internal advisory proof slice and first Judgment Spine
v0.14 fixture candidate. The whole lane is facilitator-only and carries no
durable evidence and no judgment-quality, buyer-proof, blind-use, or
fixture-admission claim. See also the mapped Daimler claim-tier classification
(Core Spine Files) and source registry (Research And Review Areas).

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/decisions/advisory_proof_slice_definition_v0.md` and `docs/decisions/advisory_runbook_scope_daimler_v0.md` | Define Daimler as the non-gate-clearing advisory proof slice and scope a future operator-facing advisory runbook; docs-only, no model execution or participant-packet exposure authorized. |
| `docs/decisions/daimler_advisory_run_authorization_decision_v0.md` and `docs/decisions/daimler_advisory_run_001_authorization_record_v0.md` | Advisory-run authorization state (gates currently closed) and the specific DAIMLER_ADVISORY_001 authorization for participant-safe prompt preparation only; not model-run authorization. |

| `docs/decisions/daimler_v0_14_selected_family_probe_gate_outcome_decision_v0.md` | Facilitator-only gate outcome: no selected target family cleared the memorization-probe gate (GPT-5.5 access-blocked; Claude Opus failed with a tool-isolation caveat); blind-use/fixture-admission not authorized. |
| `orca/product/spines/judgment/toolkit_gaps/judgment_spine_toolkit_blocker_specs_from_daimler_source_fanout_v0.md` | Toolkit capability specs inferred from the Daimler source fanout (cutoff provenance, evidence registry, packet compiler, isolation checker); planning only, not build/runtime authorization or a judgment-quality claim. |

## Inbox Warning

`docs/_inbox/` is non-authoritative. It currently contains contaminated
method-validation replay outputs and compacted-run material. Do not read or
promote those files unless the task explicitly concerns contamination,
recovery, hygiene, or comparison against canonical promoted files.

## Recommended Read Packs

### Data Capture Spine Setup CA

Use the canonical read-pack rule in
`.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md#data-capture-spine-ca-read-pack`.
This map is only a navigation aid and must not fork the Data Capture Spine
source-loading rule.

Navigation pointers for that pack live in the Product Anchor Files and Core
Spine Files sections above. Do not read the target files in full by default.
Use the targeted sections named by `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md`, then expand only when a
concrete source gap could change the Data Capture Spine CA prompt.

Exclude by default:

- method-validation replays;
- first proof run packets;
- review outputs;
- research corpus;
- `docs/_inbox/`.

### Data Capture Setup / Pressure-Test Packet

Use this packet when continuing Data Capture Spine setup, obligation-contract
pressure testing, or source-family fixture checks. This is a navigation pointer
only; it does not claim that Data Capture Spine is closed, source-of-truth
promoted, accepted, formally validated, ready for ECR/Cleaning handoff,
implementation-ready, runtime-ready, or Cleaning-complete.

Start with:

- `docs/workflows/data_capture_spine_consolidation_map_v0.md` for orientation.
- `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md#data-capture-intake-surface--msp-pressure-test-target-pack` for the canonical pressure-test read-pack rule.

Then open only the controlling owner doc named by the submap or source-loading
pack for the current claim. Do not bulk-load all capture sessions, historical
fixture files, review outputs, or Source Capture Armory docs from this repo map.

For strict source-pinning claims, compute fresh hashes from the current target
files. Do not rely on historical hashes recorded in older prompts, reviews, or
map versions unless the task is explicitly reviewing that older state.

### Offer Or Buyer Proof Work

Start with:

- `docs/decisions/orca_product_thesis_consumer_demand_v0.md`
- `orca/product/spines/product_lead/offer/orca_offer_hypothesis_v0.md`
- `orca/product/spines/product_lead/buyer_proof/orca_buyer_proof_packet_v0.md`
- `docs/decisions/orca_icp_wedge_consumer_demand_first_v0.md`
- `.agents/workflow-overlay/product-proof.md`

### Core Spine Evidence Standard Work

Start with:

- `orca/product/spines/foundation/product_contract/core_spine_v0_product_contract.md`
- `orca/product/spines/foundation/product_contract/core_spine_v0_information_production_foundation_v0.md`
- **Open `docs/research/judgment-spine/judgment_spine_consolidation_map_v0.md` first** for any Judgment Spine work; it routes to the ladder, gate ownership map, conductor, JSG-08 owner contract, current-state/decomposition, and fragrance Level 1 product-learning organizers.
- `orca/product/spines/judgment/judgment_current_state_and_decomposition_v0.md` when the work is Level 1 backtesting-first product learning: core/satellite split, commission gate, source registry, outcome labels, forecast/action/log/evaluation artifacts, satellite fill, or fragrance backtest setup.
- `orca/product/spines/judgment/claim_ladder/judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md` when the work classifies Judgment Spine claim tier, proof tier, buyer-proof boundary, or judgment-quality boundary.
- `orca/product/spines/judgment/conductor/judgment_spine_gate_ownership_map_v0.md` when the work needs to route or block Judgment Spine gate ownership before claim promotion.
- `orca/product/spines/judgment/conductor/judgment_quality_promotion_operating_model_v0.md` — **the Judgment Spine conductor; open this FIRST for the judgment run lane** (running or planning any case through gates JSG-01 to JSG-10). It sequences the gates and routes to the evidence ladder, gate ownership map, and JSG-08 owner contract rather than restating them; use it to decide a run lifecycle state or check what a partial or by-hand run can claim. It is the path toward judgment-quality evidence, not proof — by-hand runs cap at product-learning.
- `orca/product/shared/engagement_registry/engagement_logic_registry_v0.md`
- nearest boundary or proof artifact named by the request.

### Prompt Or Review Prompt Work

Start with:

- `.agents/workflow-overlay/prompt-orchestration.md`
- `.agents/workflow-overlay/template-registry.md`
- relevant prompt template under `docs/prompts/templates/`
- the target source artifact being prompted or reviewed.

## New Thread Guidance

Use a new thread or compact handoff when the next task needs more than one
recommended read pack, more than six full artifacts, or both repo-map refresh
and CA prompt drafting. The handoff should cite this map, the source-loading
overlay, the target read pack, and the files excluded by default.

## Direction Change Propagation - Reddit Graph Frontier Route

```yaml

  doctrine_changed: >
    The top-level repo map now exposes Reddit Graph Frontier as an accepted
    bounded planning lane with a Graph Frontier Register, while preserving the

    no-storage, no-scheduler, no-dashboard, and no-production-runtime

## Not-Proven Boundaries

This map does not prove acceptance, validation, readiness, buyer pull,
implementation authorization, source correctness, or freshness of every listed
artifact. Listing `orca-harness/` reflects authorized, bounded implementation
only; it does not assert runtime readiness, that its build scope is validated,
or that any gated surface (production runtime, API/commercial fetch, ECR,
Cleaning, Judgment) is authorized. Check the target artifact, retrieval header,
and current `git status` before strict claims.
