# Orca Repo Map v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Repository map
scope: Compact navigation map for Orca source loading and prompt setup.
use_when:
  - Choosing a bounded source pack before a CA prompt, review prompt, or product artifact.
  - Orienting a new thread without bulk-loading the repository.
  - Deciding which product, prompt, review, research, or workflow files are adjacent to a task.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
open_next:
  - .agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md
  - .agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md
stale_if:
  - New top-level folders (under the repo root or docs/) are added.
  - orca-harness/ packages, adapters, runners, fixtures, or its build authorizations are added or reorganized.
  - Core Spine, Data Capture Spine, Cleaning Spine, Judgment Spine, offer, proof, or prompt families are materially reorganized.
  - .agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md changes source hierarchy or the doctrine-change propagation contract.
  - A later repo-map artifact supersedes this file.
```

- Status: PROPOSED_MAP
- Artifact type: Workflow navigation artifact
- Scope: Repo navigation and source-pack selection
- Refreshed: 2026-06-04 (Judgment Spine consolidated under a single entry-map pointer)
- Implementation authorized: no

## How To Use This Map

Use this map to choose files. Do not treat it as product authority.

For source precedence, open `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md`.
For source-loading budgets, open `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md`.
For artifact retrievability, body-opening shape, stale/recheck patterns, and
temporary-artifact anti-rot guidance, open
`docs/workflows/artifact_retrievability_guide.md`.

Start-route cue: when a task may change product doctrine, architecture
doctrine, workflow authority, validation philosophy, review authority, output
authority, or a lifecycle boundary, open the Doctrine Change Propagation
Contract in `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md` before selecting
downstream surfaces. That contract owns primary `trigger` plus
`related_triggers` grammar for multi-dimensional doctrine changes. Use this map
to identify likely downstream surfaces; do not treat the map itself as
propagation evidence.

| `docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md` | Compact navigation map for bounded source-pack selection and prompt setup. |

## Orca Harness

`orca-harness/` is bounded, authorized implementation backing Data Capture
source acquisition and the v0.14 Judgment Harness. It is navigation context
here, not a runtime, acceptance, or readiness claim. Build scope is controlled
by the authorization decisions named below; surfaces outside them (production
runtime, API/commercial fetch, anti-detect, proxy, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment
design) remain gated.

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `orca-harness/source_capture/` | Source-capture packet core: models, writer, CLI support, and plaintext receipts. |
| `orca-harness/source_capture/adapters/` | Bounded capture adapters (direct HTTP, media/asset, Archive.org, browser snapshot, authenticated browser); not scraper frameworks, API SDKs, proxies, or anti-detect. |
| `orca-harness/source_observability/` | Local operator-record posture checker and limitation reporter. |
| `orca-harness/schemas/` | Pydantic v2 models for cases, judgments, scoring, and probes (v0.14). |
| `orca-harness/scoring/` | Deterministic band scorer and mapping table (v0.14 Step A); not judgment-quality proof. |
| `orca-harness/reports/` | Report-rendering code (case and source-observability reports); generated dry-run outputs under it are gitignored. |
| `orca-harness/runners/` | CLI entrypoints for case runs, memorization probe, source-capture packets, and source-observability reports. |
| `orca-harness/cases/` | Tracked deterministic fixture case(s) (e.g. TR/Casetext v0.14) with evidence, packet, and ledger; generated `scores/` and run outputs are gitignored. |
| `orca-harness/config/` | Static YAML config (contestants, models, prompts) consumed by runners. |
| `orca-harness/docs/` | Harness operating docs: source-capture packet and agent runbook, source-observability record guide, and scalability note. |
| `orca-harness/tests/` | `unit/`, `contract/`, and `integration/` tests, including no-LLM-import and no-tools contract guards. |
| `orca-harness/harness_utils.py`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml` | Shared utilities, dev shortcuts, and package metadata (optional `[browser]` Playwright extra). |

Controlling build authority:
`docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_access_tooling_build_authorization_v0.md`
(source-capture armory) and
`docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_observability_local_support_implementation_execution_authorization_v0.md`
(local source-observability support).

Generated/gitignored scratch — do not enumerate or treat as authoritative:
`orca-harness/_test_runs/`, `_auth_state/`, `pytest_*` temp dirs,
`reports/source_observability/*_dry_run.*`, `cases/*/*/scores/`, and
`memory/logs/`.

## Product Anchor Files

Use these before broad product architecture or CA setup:

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/decisions/turn_08_product_thesis_v0.md` | Orca thesis, value proposition, strategic center, broad product boundary. |
| `docs/product/orca_offer_hypothesis_v0.md` | Offer hypothesis, buyer-facing language, first proof offer, ICP boundary. |
| `docs/product/orca_buyer_proof_packet_v0.md` | First buyer-proof packet, proof gates, pull signals, kill/graduation criteria. |
| `docs/product/orca_product_lead_first_icp_wedge_decision_v0.md` | Selected first ICP wedge and decision-family focus. |
| `docs/product/orca_product_proof_lead_charter_v0.md` | Product proof lead role and proof execution boundary. |

## Judgment Spine

The Judgment Spine spans **both** trees — `docs/research/judgment-spine/` (thesis, manifest, cases, harness) and `docs/product/judgment_spine_*` plus the conductor. **Open the consolidation map first**: it is the single `retrieval_only` entry that orients across both trees and routes one hop to every owner. Do not pre-load the owners from here.

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/research/judgment-spine/judgment_spine_consolidation_map_v0.md` | **Judgment Spine entry map — open first.** Per-area summary, owner-native status, and one pointer for thesis, cases/manifest, conductor, gate ownership, evidence ladder, JSG-08, and the harness; routes to the owners rather than restating them. The path toward judgment-quality evidence, not proof; by-hand runs cap at product-learning. |

## Data Capture Harness Operating Model

Accepted design direction for how commissioned Data Capture should operate.
Retrieval/navigation context only; "accepted" here means owner-accepted for
bounded pressure-test commissioning planning, not validated, hardened, or
product-ready. v0 and v1 of the operating-model architecture are superseded by
v2 — do not load them as current.

| Path | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/product/data_capture_harness_operating_model_architecture_v2.md` | Proposed v2 hybrid operating-model architecture (roles, session lifecycle, obligation-discharge visibility, handoff boundaries); resolves the v0/v1 review findings. Not ECR/Cleaning/Judgment/runtime design. |
| `docs/product/data_capture_harness_operating_model_architecture_v2_acceptance_decision_v0.md` | Owner acceptance of v2 as the controlling operating-model architecture for pressure-test commissioning planning only; explicitly not validation, hardening, or product readiness. |
| `docs/product/data_capture_harness_product_goal_direction_signal_decision_v0.md` | Accepted decision demoting the current manual harness + BT2-04 dry run to a direction signal and stating the goal for a buyer-trustworthy, obligation-discharging, inspectable harness. |
| `docs/product/data_capture_obligation_baseline_decision_v0.md` | Accepted Data Capture obligation baseline underpinning the v2 operating-model architecture; not validation, hardening, or product readiness. |
| `docs/product/data_capture_spine_lane_product_thesis_v0.md` | Data Capture Spine lane product thesis built on the v2 operating model; states lane purpose and boundaries without designing ECR/Cleaning/Judgment or authorizing runtime. |
| `docs/product/data_capture_spine_pressure_test_commissioning_plan_v0.md` | Bounded commissioning plan for three real Data Capture pressure tests against the accepted intake surface, v2 architecture, and current obligation contract; states what the tests expose and exclude. |

## Daimler Advisory & Probe Lane

Daimler is the selected internal advisory proof slice and first Judgment Spine
v0.14 fixture candidate. The whole lane is facilitator-only and carries no
durable evidence and no judgment-quality, buyer-proof, blind-use, or
fixture-admission claim. See also the mapped Daimler claim-tier classification
(Core Spine Files) and source registry (Research And Review Areas).

## Inbox Warning

`docs/_inbox/` is non-authoritative. It currently contains contaminated
method-validation replay outputs and compacted-run material. Do not read or
promote those files unless the task explicitly concerns contamination,
recovery, hygiene, or comparison against canonical promoted files.

## Recommended Read Packs

### Data Capture Spine Setup CA

Use the canonical read-pack rule in
`.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md#data-capture-spine-ca-read-pack`.
This map is only a navigation aid and must not fork the Data Capture Spine
source-loading rule.

Navigation pointers for that pack live in the Product Anchor Files and Core
Spine Files sections above. Do not read the target files in full by default.
Use the targeted sections named by `source-loading.md`, then expand only when a
concrete source gap could change the Data Capture Spine CA prompt.

Exclude by default:

- method-validation replays;
- first proof run packets;
- review outputs;
- research corpus;
- `docs/_inbox/`.

### Data Capture Setup / Pressure-Test Packet

Use this packet when continuing Data Capture Spine setup, obligation-contract
pressure testing, or source-family fixture checks. This is a navigation pointer
only; it does not claim that Data Capture Spine is closed, source-of-truth
promoted, accepted, formally validated, ready for ECR/Cleaning handoff,
implementation-ready, runtime-ready, or Cleaning-complete.

- `docs/decisions/source_capture_packet_fixture_retention_sensitivity_decision_v0.md` when checking whether generated Source Capture Packets remain scratch, may be cited by durable closeouts, require retention/sensitivity handling, or require a cited separate admission decision before `separately_admitted` can be used.

- `docs/product/source_capture_toolbox/source_capture_toolbox_agent_usability_dry_run_closeout_v0.md` when checking whether the current armory is agent-usable from a fresh-agent dry run, what runbook lessons were patched, or how to distinguish the dry run from a source-quality win.
- `docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_access_tooling_build_authorization_v0.md` when checking whether bounded first-tranche source-access tooling builds are authorized and where API/commercial/anti-detect/proxy/runtime surfaces remain gated.
- `orca-harness/source_capture/` (see the Orca Harness section) when the task needs the actual bounded capture implementation, adapters, or CLI runners rather than the armory contract.

- `docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_observability_requirements_boundary_decision_v0.md` when checking current RQ status after Slot 3 recapture or deciding whether the older scoping artifact is stale-alone.
- `docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_observability_requirements_support_implementation_scoping_authorization_v0.md` when checking whether bounded implementation scoping is authorized from the post-recapture requirements boundary.
- `docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_observability_local_support_implementation_scoping_authorization_v0.md` when checking whether bounded local source-observability support implementation scoping is authorized.
- `docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_observability_local_support_implementation_execution_authorization_v0.md` when checking whether bounded local source-observability support implementation execution was authorized and how far it extends.
- `docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_source_observability_support_closeout_decision_v0.md` when checking whether the updated local helper was sufficient for current post-recapture Slot 3 support or whether any helper patch remains open.
- `docs/product/data_capture_spine_pressure_test_slot3_reddit_subbatch_control_note_v0.md` when continuing Slot 3 WSO/non-Reddit capture or cross-venue Slot 3 synthesis.
- `docs/product/data_capture_spine_pressure_test_slot3_interim_evidence_synthesis_v0.md` and `docs/product/data_capture_spine_pressure_test_all_slot_synthesis_post_slot3_recapture_delta_v0.md` (with `docs/decisions/data_capture_spine_post_slot3_recapture_delta_lane_local_acceptance_decision_v0.md`) when checking Slot 3 interim synthesis or the reviewed post-recapture delta against the all-slot synthesis.
- Per-slot capture-session records (`docs/product/data_capture_spine_pressure_test_slot1_mi_biws_capture_session_v0.md`, `..._slot2_teal_...`, `..._slot3_reddit_...`, `..._slot3_wso_...`, and the Reddit batch 1of2/2of2 sessions) are execution detail — open a specific one only to inspect what that slot captured; they do not harden the obligation contract.

Current pressure-test or setup handoffs should pin a freshly computed hash of
the obligation contract. The last reported working hash for the contract was
`B06BD6722F76D223E7A122B7F97B967431BDEEE5D4E41AD6DCCEF81903DAC8C5`, but
receiving lanes should recompute it before strict source-pinning claims.

Current post-clarification synthesis hash was last reported as
`46103142927A7EA7A4B61F10E0EF029614814F36438F4359C4B69B838E6C6126`. The
pressure-test synthesis usage note hash was last reported as
`7A5C5B26AA6F95C99428D7C7EB5014FD172E47DF57BFC2D92C68A1994DECAE29`. Recompute
before strict claims.

Note: older fixture headers and the adversarial review may reference earlier
synthesis or contract hashes. Treat those as historical provenance unless the
receiving lane is explicitly reviewing that older state. The adversarial review
is useful for rationale and optional clarification findings, but it reviewed
the pre-clarification synthesis hash recorded inside that report.

### Offer Or Buyer Proof Work

Start with:

- `docs/decisions/turn_08_product_thesis_v0.md`
- `docs/product/orca_offer_hypothesis_v0.md`
- `docs/product/orca_buyer_proof_packet_v0.md`
- `docs/product/orca_product_lead_first_icp_wedge_decision_v0.md`
- `.agents/workflow-overlay/product-proof.md`

### Core Spine Evidence Standard Work

Start with:

- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_product_contract.md`
- `docs/product/core_spine_v0_information_production_foundation_v0.md`
- **Open `docs/research/judgment-spine/judgment_spine_consolidation_map_v0.md` first** for any Judgment Spine work; it routes to the ladder, gate ownership map, conductor, and JSG-08 owner contract below.
- `docs/product/judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md` when the work classifies Judgment Spine claim tier, proof tier, buyer-proof boundary, or judgment-quality boundary.
- `docs/product/judgment_spine_gate_ownership_map_v0.md` when the work needs to route or block Judgment Spine gate ownership before claim promotion.
- `docs/product/judgment_quality_promotion_operating_model_v0.md` — **the Judgment Spine conductor; open this FIRST for the judgment run lane** (running or planning any case through gates JSG-01 to JSG-10). It sequences the gates and routes to the evidence ladder, gate ownership map, and JSG-08 owner contract rather than restating them; use it to decide a run lifecycle state or check what a partial or by-hand run can claim. It is the path toward judgment-quality evidence, not proof — by-hand runs cap at product-learning.
- `docs/product/engagement_logic_registry_v0.md`
- nearest boundary or proof artifact named by the request.

### Prompt Or Review Prompt Work

Start with:

- `.agents/workflow-overlay/prompt-orchestration.md`
- `.agents/workflow-overlay/template-registry.md`
- relevant prompt template under `docs/prompts/templates/`
- the target source artifact being prompted or reviewed.

## New Thread Guidance

Use a new thread or compact handoff when the next task needs more than one
recommended read pack, more than six full artifacts, or both repo-map refresh
and CA prompt drafting. The handoff should cite this map, the source-loading
overlay, the target read pack, and the files excluded by default.

## Not-Proven Boundaries

This map does not prove acceptance, validation, readiness, buyer pull,
implementation authorization, source correctness, or freshness of every listed
artifact. Listing `orca-harness/` reflects authorized, bounded implementation
only; it does not assert runtime readiness, that its build scope is validated,
or that any gated surface (production runtime, API/commercial fetch, ECR,
Cleaning, Judgment) is authorized. Check the target artifact, retrieval header,
and current `git status` before strict claims.
