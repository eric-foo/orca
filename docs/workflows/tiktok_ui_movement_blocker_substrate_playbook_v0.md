# TikTok UI Movement Blocker Substrate Playbook v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Workflow playbook
scope: >
  Cold-agent map for using Orca's bounded browser pointer-action substrate on
  TikTok live-run UI blockers without converting challenge interaction into
  capture success.
use_when:
  - A TikTok live/sessioned lane hits benign overlays, comment-surface routing
    misses, slider/captcha close diagnostics, or visually present controls that
    are not exposed as DOM buttons.
  - A cold agent needs to know which UI movement action is allowed for each
    blocker class before running or patching the live probe.

```

## Core Rule

Use the shared pointer-action substrate for TikTok UI movement. Do not hand-roll
ad hoc Playwright clicks in a live lane unless the substrate itself is missing a
needed bounded capability and the patch adds tests plus a receipt.

The substrate is:

- `BrowserPagePointerAction` in `orca-harness/source_capture/adapters/browser_snapshot.py`.
- `_run_pointer_action(...)` in the same file.
- Movement execution via `page.mouse.move(..., steps=...)` followed by
  `page.mouse.click(...)`, with randomized bounded target fractions and step
  counts from the action config.
- Sanitized receipts under `metadata.post_load_pointer_actions`; receipts must
  not include raw cookie/storage contents, raw endpoint URLs, or raw response
  bodies.

## Blocker Map

| Blocker / UI state | Action substrate | Allowed in clean run? | Success semantics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Benign TikTok onboarding/app prompt such as `Got it`, `Not now`, `Continue in browser` | `tiktok_dismiss_benign_overlay_pointer_v0` | Yes | Setup action only; excluded from comment-action count. |
| Comment surface does not load comments until tab shuffle | `comment_surface_toggle_pointer_sequence_v0`: `tiktok_open_comments_pointer_v0` -> `tiktok_open_more_like_this_pointer_v0` -> `tiktok_reopen_comments_pointer_v0` | Yes | Clean only if at least one page-owned `/api/comment/list` response is admitted. Zero response is stop/diagnosis. |
| DOM-exposed slider/captcha close control | `tiktok_challenge_modal_close_diagnostic_pointer_v0` | No, only with `--allow-challenge-close-diagnostic` | Diagnostic only. If clicked, force stop as challenge-close diagnosis. |
| Screenshot-visible but DOM-invisible slider/captcha X | `tiktok_challenge_modal_visual_close_diagnostic_pointer_v0` | No, only with `--allow-challenge-close-diagnostic` and visible challenge text | Diagnostic only. If clicked, force stop as challenge-close diagnosis. |
| Slider/captcha puzzle itself | None | Never | Do not drag, solve, or attempt puzzle interaction. |
| Login/auth wall or account risk wall | None unless separately mapped as benign prompt | Never by default | Stop and report blocker. Do not enter credentials or manipulate account state. |
| Unknown dismiss/reload blocker | None until mapped | No | Stop or patch a named substrate action with tests; do not generic-click around blockers. |

## Cold-Agent Procedure

1. Load the active handoff and this playbook. Re-read the current
   `browser_snapshot.py`, `live_batch_probe.py`, and `blocker_triage.py` before
   making strict claims.
2. Verify owner/live preconditions: dedicated non-personal warmed account,
   human-performed login, authorized auth-state label/session mode, no duplicate
   TikTok tabs, and owner authorization for the live run.
3. For a clean route-yield gate, run without `--allow-challenge-close-diagnostic`.
   The runner may dismiss benign overlays and perform the comments -> More like
   this -> comments sequence.
4. Continue only if the first video has `completed_count=1`, `challenge_count=0`,
   no failures, and `admitted_comment_response_count >= 1`.
5. If the owner explicitly authorizes challenge-close diagnosis, run with
   `--allow-challenge-close-diagnostic`. A DOM close click or visual-X close click
   must stop the run and must not admit, expand, or claim capture success.
   The visual-X diagnostic is challenge-text gated; it is not a generic
   upper-right screenshot clicker.
6. Scan outputs for forbidden markers before any admission claim. Auth-state files
   copied for a live run must be removed and verified absent after the run.

## Receipt Fields To Inspect

For benign overlay:

- `capture_receipt.benign_overlay_action.action_name`
- `target_found`, `clicked`, `candidate_count`, `matched_count`, `wait_ms`

For comment routing:

- `capture_receipt.comment_action.sequence_name`
- `action_count`
- `action_sequence[*].action_name`
- `clicked_all_targets`
- `admitted_comment_response_count`

For challenge-close diagnostics:

- `blocker_triage.challenge_close_diagnostic.action_name`
- `target_found`, `clicked`, `target_kind`, `selection_strategy`
- visual-only fields: `visual_fallback_attempted`,
  `visual_fallback_target_found`, `visual_fallback_candidate_count`,
  `visual_fallback_confidence`, `visual_fallback_crop_box`,
  `visual_fallback_screenshot_sha256`

A clicked challenge-close diagnostic receipt is evidence that the close control
was reachable. It is not evidence that TikTok capture succeeded.

## Patch Rule For New Blockers

If a new blocker needs UI movement:

1. Add a named `BrowserPagePointerAction` config, not an inline click.
2. Gate it by visible page text or by an explicit diagnostic flag when it touches
   challenge/auth-risk UI.
3. Preserve sanitized receipt fields that explain what was attempted and why.
4. Add unit tests in `test_source_capture_browser_snapshot.py` for substrate
   behavior and `test_tiktok_live_batch_probe.py` for TikTok ordering/stop
   semantics.
5. Update this playbook and the active handoff.

Never add a path where closing or dismissing a challenge can produce a completed
capture row, admission, batch expansion, product extraction, or success claim.
