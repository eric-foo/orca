## Status

Patch decision: `IMPLEMENTED_FIRST_ADAPTER_PATCH`.

Current working patch decision: `IMPLEMENTED_DEEP_CAPTURE_TRANSCRIPT_EXTRACTION_FEED_PATCH`.

Post-merge closeout: PR #441 merged on 2026-06-29 as merge commit
`9767eefdd9afff38c141b8387334b2ada988a2c2`. The first IG behavior-sync patch
is now implemented at the lake-adapter/projection layer over existing persisted
IG grid, standalone audio ASR, deep-capture, and product-extraction records.

Current adapter-level closure:

- IG now has a shortcode-keyed behavioral item/index adapter over existing lake
  records.
- The adapter feeds grid candidate/ranking rows, comment sets, standalone audio
  transcript records, deep-capture transcript records, and product extraction
  results into the IG behavioral projection.
- Persistence correlation is programmatic at the adapter/projection layer for
  grid packet ids, audio packet ids, deep-capture/comment record ids, and
  extraction record paths.
- Hidden failures from raw packet load, grid projection, ASR record parsing, and
  product-record parsing are residualized instead of silently dropped.

Accepted residuals after PR #441 plus the current deep-capture e2e patch:

- No shared IG/YT core has been introduced.
- No live IG capture has been run or validated in this closeout.
- Completed cue-bearing deep-capture transcript records are now eligible for the
  product-extraction feed through the IG runner.
- Multiple eligible deep-capture transcript records under one shortcode can still
  require stronger exact source-key disambiguation if product records share the
  shortcode anchor.
- Deep-capture run receipt normalization remains a future patch candidate.
- Downstream consumer integration is not proven by this ledger.

The detailed gap table below is retained as historical pre-implementation
evidence from the source-refresh lane. Do not read its "gap remains" language as
current when it conflicts with this post-merge status.

## Start Preflight

```text
orca_start_preflight:
  agents_read: yes
  overlay_read: yes
  source_pack: custom handoff load contract plus IG/YT focused implementation and tests
  edit_permission: docs-write
  target_scope: IG behavior-sync gap ledger and bounded patch decision
  dirty_state_checked: yes
  blocked_if_missing: PR #432 live state, YouTube behavioral contract, IG source/test reread, capture playbook/recon reread
```

Post-merge route note: the original source-refresh lane ran while PR #432 was
an open draft. Current closeout checks observed both the YouTube contract PR and
the IG adapter PR merged, so future work should use merged `origin/main` unless
a later PR supersedes these commits.

## Confirmed Reference State

Live PR checks observed during post-merge closeout:

- PR #432: `MERGED` at `2026-06-28T18:26:36Z`, merge commit
  `658ac473c2164bc3f4da4840ee80c3f568733d03`, CI `orca-harness-tests`

  `9767eefdd9afff38c141b8387334b2ada988a2c2`, CI `orca-harness-tests`
  `SUCCESS`.

Implication: the YouTube behavioral contract and first IG behavioral lake
adapter patch are now merged-main references. The source-read ledger below is
retained as historical evidence from the pre-implementation source refresh.

## YouTube Reference Behavior

Use the YouTube contract as a behavior reference, not an implementation recipe.

The reference behavior to compare is:

- one projected item keyed by a resolvable single YouTube video id;
- metadata/comments posture preserved when present;
- transcript sources carry route, source status, posture, cue count, eligibility, and source keys;
- extraction statuses are attached to transcript sources;
- per-item `behavioral_completeness.status` is the extraction rollup, and `complete` is true only when the rollup is exactly `complete`;
- runtime acquisition and LLM imports stay outside the projection module;
- residuals keep discovery, source, posture, metadata mismatch, and extraction problems visible.

## Gap Ledger

| Area | Current IG source-backed behavior | YouTube-level behavior to match | Gap / decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Identity | Grid projection rows carry `entity_namespace="instagram"` and `content_shortcode`; audio transcript records carry both `video_id` and `shortcode` as the IG shortcode; deep-capture record sets are anchored by shortcode. Sources: `ig_reels_grid_projection.py:109-137`, `ig_reels_audio_packet.py:193-207`, `ig_reels_audio_packet.py:293-307`, `ig_reels_deep_capture_lake.py:142-148`. | A single item key must resolve before projecting a completeness claim. | Match behavior by naming `platform_item_id=shortcode`. Do not rename every physical anchor first. Gap remains: no single IG behavioral record or index ties grid packet id, audio packet id, deep-capture record id, transcript anchor, comments, and extraction anchor together. |
| Candidate/ranking limits | Grid capture is logged-out `/reels/` page-load only, no item fanout; it preserves DOM rows, passive JSON candidates, joined rows, pinned inference, warning notes, limitation notes, and receipt non-claims. Static `/p/` rows are filtered from the reels traction series and static view count is not applicable. Sources: `run_source_capture_ig_reels_grid_packet.py:141-177`, `run_source_capture_ig_reels_grid_packet.py:262-330`, `ig_reels_grid_projection.py:421-459`. | Candidate/ranking evidence should stay visible without overclaiming traction strength. | Mostly matches. Required future patch is vocabulary/record shape, not acquisition. The behavior record should expose ranking basis and metric limitations as first-class fields rather than leaving them only in packet slices and projection rows. |
| Source-surface disagreement | Grid projection re-attaches all source-surface count candidates, marks missing JSON, rejects ambiguous duplicate-shortcode anchors, and never reports DOM as the chosen source surface. Sources: `ig_reels_grid_projection.py:95-137`, `ig_reels_grid_projection.py:498-519`, `ig_reels_grid_projection.py:622-640`; tests at `test_source_capture_ig_reels_projection.py:39-69`, `test_source_capture_ig_reels_projection.py:226-257`, `test_source_capture_ig_reels_projection.py:292-342`. | Source disagreements and ambiguous anchors should become residuals or limitations, not hidden assumptions. | Matches the behavioral direction. Future behavior record should carry this as per-item residual/limitation pressure. |
| Comments posture | Deep capture parses `AudienceComment` records from rendered DOM, dedupes by comment id, skips incomplete nodes, and returns comments when render succeeds even if audio fails. Sources: `ig_reels_comments.py:113-167`, `ig_reels_deep_capture.py:190-226`; tests at `test_ig_reels_deep_capture.py:178-209`. | Comment posture should distinguish captured, empty, blocked/render unavailable, parse failed, and not attempted. | Gap remains. Current source carries comments and failure notes, but not a normalized `IGCommentSet` posture. `render_unavailable` is represented through transcript posture/no comments, not a dedicated comment posture. |
| Transcript source records | Standalone audio writes a raw `SourceCapturePacket` with `source_family="instagram_creator"` and `source_surface="ig_reels_audio"`, then appends a `transcript_asr` derived record with posture, cues, provenance, source packet id, file id, and SHA. Sources: `ig_reels_audio_packet.py:222-261`, `ig_reels_audio_packet.py:293-318`; tests at `test_ig_reels_audio_packet.py:69-104`, `test_ig_reels_audio_packet.py:170-236`. | Transcript sources should carry route, source status, posture, cue count, eligibility, and source key. | Partial match. Standalone audio has enough raw material for a normalized transcript-source record, but the normalized record does not exist yet. |
| Deep-capture transcript source | One render yields both comments and media handle; runner statuses include `render_unavailable`, `no_audio_handle`, and `download_failed`; persisted deep-capture record sets contain transcript posture, cues, media provenance, and completion marker. Sources: `ig_reels_deep_capture.py:171-226`, `ig_reels_deep_capture_lake.py:101-148`; tests at `test_ig_reels_deep_capture.py:136-209`, `test_ig_reels_deep_capture_lake.py:43-69`, `test_ig_reels_deep_capture_lake.py:107-132`. | All observed transcript sources should either enter the transcript-source set or be explicit non-canonical residuals with deterministic lookup. | Gap remains and is sharper than the old spec: the deep-capture runner can carry `ok` as transcriber posture while standalone audio normalizes to `transcribed/no_speech/failed`. A future patch must normalize deep-capture posture before using it in a shared completeness rollup. |
| Transient media handling | Deep-capture media URLs are transient handles and are redacted from persisted payloads; only provenance such as host and handle-used status persists. Sources: `ig_reels_deep_capture.py:135-139`, `ig_reels_deep_capture_lake.py:113-132`; tests at `test_ig_reels_deep_capture_lake.py:60-69`. | Persistence can differ by platform if non-durable/transient artifacts are not laundered into evidence. | Matches. Keep IG-specific redaction and do not copy YouTube packet anchors or caption artifacts into IG. |
| Run receipts | Grid packets carry packet receipt metadata, limitations, warnings, visible mode changes, non-claims, and access/media/archive postures. Audio runner has typed exit statuses for access-gated, unavailable, and ASR failure visibility. Deep-capture runner prints per-run comments/transcript/audio-handle posture and optionally persists a record set. Sources: `run_source_capture_ig_reels_grid_packet.py:183-217`, `run_source_capture_ig_reels_grid_packet.py:297-334`, `run_source_capture_ig_reels_audio_packet.py:55-77`, `run_source_capture_ig_reels_deep_capture.py:218-247`. | Completeness should be inspectable from durable records, not stdout or human convention. | Gap remains. Grid/audio have stronger receipt surfaces than deep capture. Deep-capture stdout is not enough for a behavior-level run receipt; persisted record-set completion is not a complete run receipt. |
| Persistence correlation | Grid projection reads raw packet bytes and projects rows; audio transcript is a derived record under the audio packet id; deep capture is a shortcode-anchored derived record set; product mentions are under transcript anchors. Sources: `ig_reels_grid_projection.py:198-316`, `ig_reels_audio_packet.py:310-318`, `ig_reels_deep_capture_lake.py:142-148`, `run_ig_reels_product_extract.py:164-203`. | A future reader should resolve item -> transcript/comment/extraction anchors programmatically. | Gap remains. Current surfaces are deterministic individually, but there is no single shortcode-to-all-anchors bridge/index. Do not pretend packet id, shortcode, and record-set anchors are one physical shape. |
| Extraction feed | IG extraction discovers standalone audio packet transcripts and completed deep-capture transcript record sets. Standalone audio uses packet anchors; deep capture uses the shortcode anchor and only `transcribed`/`ok` cue-bearing records. It skips grid packets and returns statuses `extracted`, `skipped_done`, `partial_needs_cleanup`, `failed`, and `discovery_failed`. Sources: `run_ig_reels_product_extract.py`, `ig_reels_behavioral_projection.py`; tests at `test_ig_reels_product_extract.py`, `test_ig_reels_behavioral_projection.py`, and `test_ig_reels_behavioral_lake.py`. | Source extraction statuses should feed a per-item rollup and avoid hidden complete claims. | Adapter-level match for single eligible sources per anchor. Residual: product mention records still do not carry an exact deep-capture source key, so multiple eligible deep-capture records sharing the shortcode anchor can require ambiguity residuals rather than exact attachment. |
| Residual visibility | Current IG residuals/failures include missing shortcode, missing JSON, ambiguous shortcode join, no passive JSON join, static view-count not applicable, access-gated audio, unavailable audio, transcriber failure posture, render unavailable, no audio handle, download failed, discovery failed, extraction failed, and partial cleanup. Sources above. | Residuals should be centralized enough that an item cannot claim complete while a source failed or was skipped silently. | Gap remains. Residuals are real but distributed across packet limitations, projection residuals, runner exit statuses, transcript posture, and extraction result rows. A behavior projection/index should centralize them before any per-item completeness claim. |
| Focused tests | Focused tests cover grid projection disagreement/static handling, audio identity/provenance/postures, deep-capture comments/audio-handle outcomes, deep-capture lake completion/redaction, standalone-audio extraction, deep-capture extraction, and behavioral projection/lake rollup attachment. | Tests should prove the behavior contract that future source-changing patches depend on. | Existing tests support current adapter behavior. Missing proofs: live IG capture validation, downstream consumer integration, deeper run receipt normalization, and exact source-key disambiguation for multiple deep-capture records under one shortcode. |

## Accepted Residuals

- IG can remain ASR-only in v0.
- IG can keep separate grid, deep-capture, standalone-audio, and extraction runners.
- IG can keep shortcode-anchored deep-capture record sets and packet-id-anchored audio transcripts because the behavioral adapter bridges them by shortcode before whole-item completeness claims.
- Deep-capture transcript extraction is no longer a blanket residual for completed cue-bearing records; the remaining residual is exact disambiguation when several eligible deep-capture records share one shortcode anchor.
- YouTube PR #432 is merged-main behavioral reference only; this patch still does not copy YouTube acquisition mechanics into IG.

## Patch Decision

Decision: `IMPLEMENTED_BY_PR_441_FOR_ADAPTER_LEVEL_BEHAVIOR`.

The older IG back-fix spec remains useful for residuals and future sequencing,
but its pre-implementation gate has been closed for the first adapter-level
slice. PR #441 implemented the bounded source-changing patch over existing lake
surfaces without copying YouTube acquisition mechanics.

Next patch candidates, if authorized, are no longer "create the adapter". They
are narrower follow-ons:

1. fixture/live-data validation of IG behavior records on representative lake
   data;
2. downstream consumer integration against the IG behavior record;
3. exact source-key disambiguation if multiple deep-capture transcripts under
   one shortcode need independent product-record attachment;
4. deeper run receipt normalization for deep capture.

Still do not copy YouTube's HTTP/youtubei route, caption priority, packet
anchors, runner structure, or acquisition method into IG.

Earlier, the PR #432 reference worktree was read-only for practical test/write
purposes because creating its `_scratch` test directory hit a Windows ACL
`PermissionError`. This ledger was therefore written and verified in the
separate `codex/ig-behavioral-sync-gap-ledger` worktree.

## Non-Claims

This ledger does not claim:

- PR #432 or PR #441 prove live capture, shared-core, downstream readiness, or full platform parity;
- IG parity beyond adapter-level behavioral projection over existing lake surfaces is implemented;
- live IG capture was run;
- shared capture core implementation is authorized;
- YouTube acquisition coverage is complete;
- TikTok behavior is known;
- product readiness, legal/access approval, or live-scale validation.
