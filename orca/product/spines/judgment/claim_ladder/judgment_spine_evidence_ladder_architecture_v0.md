```

## Purpose

This artifact establishes the Judgment Spine evidence ladder so future Orca work
can classify a run or artifact by what it actually supports.

The ladder prevents a lower-tier signal from being reused as a stronger claim.
A usable manual advisory answer can be valuable product-learning evidence, but
it does not become buyer proof or judgment-quality evidence unless the separate
promotion gates for those tiers are satisfied.

## Measurement Target

The Judgment Spine measures **the best move given the evidence available at the
decision point** — not correctness against the sealed real-world outcome (Outcome). The
unit of evaluation is the quality of the decision under the case (Case)'s evidence
constraints (the frozen participant packet and frozen band inputs, judged on the
case's action ladder), consistent with the thesis goal of *right-sized action
under evidence constraints*
(`docs/research/judgment-spine/judgment_spine_thesis_v0.md`).

This is a structural property of the spine, not an aspiration:

- **Scoring grades the call, not the outcome.** `JSG-07` scores the blind
  judgment against the frozen band inputs and the case action band; it does not
  read the sealed outcome. Scoring and reveal are separate gates
  (`judgment_spine_gate_ownership_map_v0.md`: `JSG-07` owns scoring, `JSG-08`
  owns reveal/calibration).
- **The sealed outcome is a blindness input and a learning input, never a
  grade.** It is held out of construction and scoring to prevent leakage
  (`.agents/workflow-overlay/product-proof.md` zero-spoiler lanes), and at
  `JSG-08` it feeds reveal/calibration *learning* under
  `calibration_changes_score: no`
  (`judgment_spine_reveal_calibration_owner_contract_v0.md`). Calibration may
  compare the call against the later outcome, but only under an explicitly
  declared frame (`later_outcome_alignment`); it never silently converts the
  outcome into the score.
- **No outcome (resulting) bias.** A judgment is not better because the outcome
  later matched it, nor worse because it did not. A defensible best-move call the
  world later contradicted remains a good judgment under this measure; a lucky
  call the evidence did not support remains a weak one.

Consequence for claims: completed judgment-quality evidence is evidence of a
clean, scoreable judgment *under evidence constraints* — it is **not** evidence
that Orca predicted an outcome. Outcome prediction is not a Judgment Spine claim
at any tier.

      - commercial readiness
```

## Closeout States

`closeout_state` is required whenever a Judgment Spine artifact classifies
proof, readiness, validation, fixture admission, scoring, blind use, or
judgment-quality status.

The state records where the evaluated claim actually closed after both source
quality and execution quality were checked. It is not a fourth evidence tier,
and it does not rename Product-Learning, Buyer-Proof, or Judgment-Quality.

```yaml
judgment_spine_closeout_states:
  no_durable_evidence:
    use_when: >
      The evaluated claim has no durable raw output, run receipt, source
      custody receipt, or other artifact that can carry that claim. Adjacent
      specs, prompts, wrappers, runbooks, source lists, or prior-thread memory
      do not count as durable evidence for a run, answer, proof, or judgment.
    claim_cap: none
    may_support:
      - route planning
      - gap identification
      - tooling backlog discovery
    blocked_claims:
      - completed product-learning evidence
      - buyer proof
      - judgment-quality evidence

  unreceipted_product_learning_context:
    use_when: >
      Some durable material exists for the evaluated product-learning surface,
      but the minimum product-learning receipt is incomplete or the material is
      limited to design context, source-custody context, a durable owner-note
      artifact, or unsealed-answer context. A durable owner-note must have a
      path, hash, timestamp, or equivalent retrieval handle; prior-thread
      memory or owner recollection alone does not qualify.
    claim_cap: product-learning context only
    may_support:
      - product narration questions
      - packet patch hypotheses
      - operator-friction discovery
      - source/tooling blocker discovery
    blocked_claims:
      - completed product-learning evidence
      - buyer proof
      - judgment-quality evidence

  completed_product_learning_evidence:
    use_when: >
      The minimum product-learning receipt is complete, and stronger
      buyer-proof and judgment-quality receipts are absent.
    claim_cap: product_learning
    blocked_claims:
      - buyer proof
      - judgment-quality evidence

  completed_buyer_proof_evidence:
    use_when: >
      The minimum buyer-proof receipt is complete, and a separate
      judgment-quality receipt is absent.
    claim_cap: buyer_proof
    blocked_claims:
      - judgment-quality evidence

  completed_judgment_quality_evidence:
    use_when: >
      The minimum judgment-quality receipt is complete under the controlling
      harness contract.
    claim_cap: judgment_quality
    blocked_claims:
      - buyer validation by itself
      - willingness-to-pay proof by itself
      - product readiness by itself

  blocked_or_contaminated:
    use_when: >
      Leakage, post-cutoff contamination, tool-use breach, missing isolation,
      missing source identity, unreconciled scoring failure, or another
      material defect breaks the evaluated gate.
    claim_cap: weakest unaffected gate, often none
    required_note: name the failed or contaminated gate before any reuse.
```

## Source-Quality x Execution-Quality Matrix

The matrix is a cap table for the evaluated claim, not a checklist that grants
success. The fourth column states the ceiling after the named receipts and
gates are independently satisfied; it is not permission to claim the ceiling.
If a row does not fit, use the weakest-cleared-gate rule below and record the
missing evidence.

| Source-quality state | Execution-quality state | Default `closeout_state` | Claim cap, not success grant |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No durable artifact for the evaluated claim | Any | `no_durable_evidence` | No evidence claim; routing/gap discovery only. |
| Design/control artifacts only | No run, answer, buyer use, or sealed output | `no_durable_evidence` for run/proof/judgment claims | Design input only. |
| Durable source custody or packet context, but incomplete product-learning receipt | No sealed or gate-bearing execution | `unreceipted_product_learning_context` | Product-learning context only. |
| Complete product-learning receipt | Manual or non-gate-bearing execution | `completed_product_learning_evidence` | Product-Learning. |
| Complete buyer-proof receipt | Buyer-qualified use/readback under proof gates | `completed_buyer_proof_evidence` | Buyer-Proof. |
| Complete judgment-quality receipt | Clean isolated execution, sealed output, scoring, reveal/calibration record | `completed_judgment_quality_evidence` | Judgment-Quality. |
| Any material source or execution contamination | Any affected execution | `blocked_or_contaminated` | Weakest unaffected gate; often none. |

## Promotion Rules

Evidence may move upward only through an explicit promotion gate. A lower-tier
artifact can inform the next tier's design, but it cannot carry its claim
forward.

Weakest-cleared-gate rule: a Judgment Spine classification must cap the claim
at the weakest required source-quality or execution-quality gate actually
cleared. If source quality and execution quality point to different caps, use
the lower cap. Missing evidence is a cap, not a pass.

Sub-floor rule: when the evaluated run, answer, buyer-proof artifact, scoring
artifact, or judgment-quality claim has no durable evidence of its own, the
state is `no_durable_evidence`. Specs, prompts, wrappers, runbooks, source
capture receipts, architecture documents, prior-thread memory, or owner
recollection may explain what should happen next, but they do not fill the
missing run/proof/judgment receipt.

| From | To | Required promotion gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product Learning | Buyer Proof | Qualified buyer, live decision context, memo plus evidence appendix, buyer readback, and pull-versus-praise classification under `.agents/workflow-overlay/product-proof.md`. |
| Product Learning | Judgment Quality | New gate-bearing authorization, frozen packet boundary, structural no-tools evidence, memorization-probe routing, sealed blind judgment, and scoring path under `contestant_no_tools_execution_contract_v0.md`. |
| Buyer Proof | Judgment Quality | Separate harness-grade run. Buyer usefulness, memo circulation, deck interest, or paid-sprint pull does not prove clean model judgment. |
| Judgment Quality | Buyer Proof | Separate buyer-facing proof. A clean scored run can support product narration, but buyer proof still requires a qualified decision owner and live decision use. |

## Required Receipts By Tier

### Claim Classification Record

Any artifact making or blocking a stronger Judgment Spine claim should name the
classification inline or co-reference a durable classification record:

```yaml
judgment_spine_claim_classification:
  evaluated_claim_surface:
  source_quality_state:
  execution_quality_state:
  closeout_state:
  claim_cap:
  weakest_missing_or_failed_gate:
  receipt_artifact_or_gap:
  non_claims:
    - not validation unless separately proven
    - not readiness unless separately proven
    - not buyer proof unless the buyer-proof receipt is complete
    - not judgment-quality evidence unless the judgment-quality receipt is complete
```

### Product Learning Receipt

Minimum receipt fields:

```yaml
product_learning_receipt:
  case_or_packet_id:
  selected_surface_named_before_run: true | false | unknown
  model_or_chat_surface:
  prompt_artifact:
  prompt_body_only_confirmed: true | false | unknown
  raw_answer_location:
  owner_readback_captured: true | false
  product_signals:
    - <signal>
  friction_signals:
    - <friction>
  non_claims:
    - not buyer proof
    - not product proof
    - not clean no-tools evidence
    - not fixture validation or admission
    - not scoring
    - not judgment-quality evidence
```

Missing pre-run surface selection weakens process hygiene but does not make the
answer useless for product learning. It does block any attempt to call the run
clean, controlled, gate-bearing, or stronger than product-learning evidence.

### Buyer-Proof Receipt

Minimum receipt fields:

```yaml
buyer_proof_receipt:
  buyer_or_decision_owner:
  live_decision_context:
  memo_artifact:
  evidence_appendix_artifact:
  readback_or_use_signal:
  trust_state: trust_open | trust_objection | trust_refusal
  pull_grade: A | B | C | D
  commercial_next_step_signal:
  non_claims:
    - not judgment-quality evidence
    - not clean no-tools evidence
    - not fixture admission
    - not product readiness unless separately accepted
```

### Judgment-Quality Receipt

Minimum receipt fields:

```yaml
judgment_quality_receipt:
  case_id:
  selected_model_family_and_id:
  owner_authorization:
  frozen_participant_packet_hash:
  frozen_facilitator_ledger_hash:
  prompt_hash:
  memorization_probe_result:
  execution_isolation_result: proven
  sealed_blind_judgment_hash:
  scoring_result:
  outcome_reveal_or_calibration_record:
  failure_events:
  non_claims:
    - not buyer validation
    - not willingness-to-pay proof
    - not product readiness by itself
```

## Daimler / GPT-5.4 Boundary

The Daimler GPT-5.4 manual advisory material is not a completed evidence
receipt in this lane.

Current source state:

- `docs/decisions/daimler_advisory_run_001_authorization_record_v0.md` records
  `advisory_run_execution_status: not_run_by_this_record` and leaves execution
  preconditions as `REQUIRED_UNSET`.
- `docs/prompts/handoffs/daimler_advisory_run_001_manual_execution_handoff_v0.md`
  records that no model run has occurred and no advisory output exists yet.
- `docs/prompts/wrappers/daimler_advisory_run_001_manual_execution_handoff_wrapper_v0.md`
  preserves the boundary that wrapper plumbing is not validation, scoring,
  product proof, or judgment quality.

Therefore this artifact does not claim that a Daimler GPT-5.4 answer exists as
a durable Orca evidence artifact. Any owner-stated, prior-thread, or otherwise
unreceipted Daimler advisory output may be used only as candidate
product-learning context until a completed `product_learning_receipt` records a
real `raw_answer_location`.

If a later durable Daimler advisory answer is supplied, the minimum
classification remains `product_learning` unless and until the stronger
promotion gates are satisfied. The completed receipt must record the selected
surface, model or chat surface, prompt artifact, prompt-body-only confirmation,
raw answer location, owner readback, product signals, friction signals, and
non-claims.

Blocked stronger claims:

- No durable raw answer location is recorded in this lane.
- The current run-control surfaces still say no run or no output exists.
- No selected chat surface is durably recorded as completed before a run.
- No structural no-tools execution occurred.
- GPT-5.4 was not shown to have cleared a memorization probe for Daimler.
- No frozen facilitator ledger, sealed blind judgment artifact, scoring result,
  reveal, calibration record, buyer readback, or buyer pull signal exists from
  this run.

Therefore the current Daimler material may inform packet patch hypotheses,
product narration questions, and architecture planning only as unreceipted
product-learning context. It must not be cited as buyer proof, product proof,
fixture validation or admission, clean no-tools evidence, scoring readiness,
blind-use readiness, or judgment-quality evidence.

## Core / Satellite Boundary

Core owns:

- claim-tier vocabulary;
- closeout-state vocabulary;
- tier promotion gates;
- weakest-cleared-gate cap rules;
- required receipt minima;
- non-claim boundaries;
- evidence-reuse limits across tiers.

Satellites own:

- case facts and packet construction;
- source-family choices;
- model/provider or chat-surface choices;
- case-specific probe status;
- buyer/demo packaging;
- owner readback notes;
- case-specific patch priorities.

Daimler remains satellite. The evidence ladder is case-agnostic.

## Non-Claims

- This artifact does not validate Judgment Spine.
- This artifact does not prove buyer pull.
- This artifact does not constitute buyer-proof evidence.
- This artifact does not prove product readiness.
- This artifact does not prove judgment quality.
- This artifact does not authorize model execution.
- This artifact does not authorize API execution.
- This artifact does not authorize scoring.
- This artifact does not admit any fixture.
- This artifact does not freeze a facilitator ledger.
- This artifact does not resolve reveal/calibration gate ownership.
- This artifact does not measure or claim correctness against the real-world
  outcome; outcome prediction is not a Judgment Spine claim.
- This artifact does not authorize implementation, runtime design, tests,
  deployment, commits, pushes, or PRs.

Required boundary: claim architecture only; not validation or readiness.

    The Judgment Spine evidence ladder now states an explicit Measurement Target
    principle: the spine measures the best move given the evidence available at
    the decision point, not correctness against the sealed real-world outcome.
    Scoring (JSG-07) grades the call against the frozen band inputs and action
    band and never reads the outcome; the sealed outcome is a blindness input and
    a JSG-08 reveal/calibration learning input under calibration_changes_score:

    barred and outcome prediction is not a Judgment Spine claim at any tier. This

    thesis goal of right-sized action under evidence constraints); it renames,
    merges, splits, or retires no claim tier, closeout state, or receipt minimum.

      reason: >
        Already encodes the principle: JSG-08 calibration carries
        calibration_changes_score: no, and its Calibration Frame Boundary forces
        an explicit frame (later_outcome_alignment vs action/decision-quality
        alignment) so the outcome is never silently converted into the score. It
        points to this ladder via open_next; no edit needed.
    - path: orca/product/spines/judgment/conductor/judgment_spine_gate_ownership_map_v0.md
      reason: >
        Already separates JSG-07 (scoring) from JSG-08 (reveal/calibration) and
        states JSG-07 still owns scoring. The measurement target is the principle
        behind that separation, not a change to gate ownership.
    - path: orca/product/spines/judgment/conductor/judgment_quality_promotion_operating_model_v0.md
      reason: >
        The conductor already sequences scoring (JSG-07) before reveal (JSG-08)
        and treats sealed_awaiting_outcome as a non-binding annotation that adds
        no gate clearance; it routes to this ladder and mints no claim vocabulary.
    - path: docs/research/judgment-spine/judgment_spine_thesis_v0.md
      reason: >
        The north-star thesis already optimizes for right-sized action under
        evidence constraints; this ladder section restates that as the product
        claim doc's measurement target and cites the thesis. The thesis is the
        research-lane source, not the product claim surface the owner asked to
        carry the principle.
    - path: .agents/workflow-overlay/product-proof.md
      reason: >
        Already keeps participant / facilitator / blind-judgment /
        outcome-calibration lanes separate ("ask what should be done, not tell or
        imply what happened"; outcome_calibration is post-reveal). Buyer-proof
        semantics are unchanged, so the ladder stale_if on product-proof is not
        tripped.
    - path: .agents/workflow-overlay/validation-gates.md
      reason: >
        The Judgment Spine claim-tier gate already routes claim classification to
        this ladder. The measurement target is upstream of the tiers and changes
        no tier, closeout state, or receipt minimum, so the gate mechanics are
        unchanged.
    - path: AGENTS.md / .agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md / docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md
      reason: >
        Routing and start-route surfaces; grep-checked and they carry no
        measurement-target framing (they route claim-tier work to this ladder and
        define no measurement semantics). No route changed.

    Executed 2026-06-15 after this patch (the change adds a durable rule, so the
    search is run, not skipped). No controlling surface frames the measurement as
    correctness-vs-outcome. Hits either confirm the principle — the reveal
    contract's Calibration Frame Boundary (action matching vs outcome matching),
    the canoo-walmart outcome_calibration ("a retailer's actual commitment does
    not prove that commitment was the right call ... the supplier's later failure
    does not prove every protected engagement path was wrong") and its
    facilitator ledger ("does not prove the owner-assisted judgment in a
    scoreable way until outcome calibration defines the comparison method") — or
    use "correct/correctness" in unrelated senses (capture field correctness in
    jsg01_source_side_receipt_translator_v0.md; tell-audit derivability in
    conductor_construction_integrity_probe_addendum_v1.md). One research
    discovery doc (decide_vs_confirm_case_discovery_results_v0.md) uses loose
    "score it WHEN the outcome resolves" wording for a forward-test option
    explicitly recorded as "an option, not a decision"; it is not a controlling
    claim surface and the new principle governs, so it was not edited
    (out of scope for this propagation).
