## Status

Status: `SOURCE_QUALITY_STATE_ASSEMBLER_ARCHITECTURE_V0`.

This artifact records the architecture boundary for a possible Source Quality
State Assembler. It is an architecture note for future scoped work, not an
implementation plan and not implementation authorization.

## Purpose

Mini God-Tier is Orca's smallest complete source-quality target for a bounded
source unit. It is not maximal collection. It is best in-bound body possession
plus identity/provenance, bounded source-language anchors, coverage or drift
posture, visible limitations, and lifecycle posture sufficient for downstream
use or visible stop.

The Source Quality State Assembler exists to make that target repeatable across
multiple already-bounded source units without creating fake completeness. It
would assemble existing queue-row, packet, helper-output, lifecycle, and
limitation state into an inspectable state view.

The word "conductor" is intentionally not used for this layer. A conductor can
sound like a gate sequencer or authority surface. This layer is only a state
assembler/router: it reads existing state, preserves stops, and routes
quality-bearing conclusions back to the operator.

## Use This For

- Checking whether a future helper can safely combine existing source-quality
  row state.
- Keeping packet-write success separate from source-quality result tokens.
- Preserving metadata-only, body-missing, scratch, and limitation states across
  a multi-row source-quality pass.
- Borrowing Judgment Spine conductor discipline as a pattern without importing
  Judgment authority.

## Do Not Use This For

- Source discovery or source selection.
- Source acquisition, runner dispatch, archive retrieval, browser capture,
  media capture, API calls, scraper behavior, or fallback chaining.
- Source-quality scoring, credibility, relevance ranking, inclusion, exclusion,
  fixture admission, rights, retention, sensitivity, or lifecycle admission.
- Automated finalization of `mini_god_tier_met`.
- ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, buyer-proof, or commercial-readiness claims.

## Accepted Target Architecture

The accepted v0 target is a Source Capture-owned, read-only assembler/router
over already-bounded source-quality rows and existing Source Capture Packets.

Its only allowed flow is:

```text
already-bounded queue row
  -> existing packet path
  -> packet-exists-at-cited-path check
  -> packet-inspectability check
  -> already-produced or read-only report-skeleton helper output surfaced verbatim
  -> operator-finalization requirement
  -> per-row and combined state census
```

The combined output shape is a state census, not a verdict. It may count or
list source units by posture, but it must keep each row's result token,
limitations, lifecycle state, and operator-completion requirements visible. It
must not claim that a batch passed, that a ladder completed, that a fixture is
admitted, or that source quality was scored.

## Core Responsibilities

The v0 state assembler may:

- read already-bounded source-unit queue rows;
- read existing Source Capture Packet directories or manifests;
- check whether the cited packet path exists;
- check whether the packet is inspectable enough for the existing report
  skeleton helper to read;
- surface already-produced helper output, or invoke only the existing read-only
  report-skeleton helper against an existing packet manifest;
- surface the helper's `suggested_result_token`,
  `result_token_finalization`, `operator_completion_required`,
  `visible_limitations`, and `lifecycle_state` without strengthening them;
- echo the row's existing workflow state from the queue template's row-status
  vocabulary;
- preserve input order in any combined view;
- emit a failure-preserving state census.

## Forbidden Responsibilities

The v0 state assembler must not:

- discover, select, rank, include, exclude, or search for sources;
- launch any Source Capture runner;
- launch the report-skeleton CLI as a runner-dispatch substitute unless a later
  implementation scope explicitly authorizes that read-only invocation shape;
- fetch, retrieve, archive, render, screenshot, preserve media, call APIs, or
  automate browsers;
- parse raw source bodies for meaning;
- infer source-language anchors;
- score source quality, credibility, relevance, or Judgment meaning;
- finalize `mini_god_tier_met` by automation;
- auto-advance a row to `reported`;
- assert `ready_for_tool_run` as dispatch authorization;
- mint result tokens, lifecycle states, row-status tokens, or aggregate status
  vocabulary;
- convert `_test_runs/` packet paths into durable evidence;
- emit `recommended_fixture_admission` or `separately_admitted` without the
  separate decision/reference required by the Mini God-Tier profile and helper;
- create a durable combined report unless a later owner decision authorizes the
  output form and claim boundary;
- produce ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, buyer-proof, or product-readiness outputs.

## Judgment Pattern Reference

Judgment Spine has a conductor pattern that sequences owned gates, verifies
receipts, routes to the next owner, and carries a no-authority invariant. That
pattern is useful here only as discipline:

- route, do not restate;
- preserve visible stops instead of skipping rows;
- do not compute the quality claim being routed;
- treat missing receipts or missing inputs as stops, not success.

This artifact does not import Judgment authority. It does not borrow Judgment
claim tiers, credibility analysis, Signal Use, Decision Strength, Action
Ceiling, reveal/calibration, scoring, or gate semantics. Judgment remains the
owner of inference and decision-use effects. Source Capture remains the owner
of capture and source-quality support mechanics.

## Fake-Success Guardrails

| Fake-success vector | Required guardrail |
| --- | --- |
| Packet exists, therefore source body is possessed. | Keep helper body posture and result token visible; metadata-only remains metadata-only. |
| Archive availability metadata becomes archive body preservation. | Preserve `archive_body_not_preserved` or `body_possession_not_proven` when no inspectable body is present. |
| Empty visible limitations becomes clean pass. | Preserve `result_token_finalization: operator_review_required`; empty helper limitations never finalize met-ness. |
| Scratch packet becomes durable evidence. | Preserve packet lifecycle and `_test_runs/` scratch boundary. |
| Helper suggestion becomes final result. | Keep `suggested_result_token` distinct from operator-finalized report blocks. |
| Combined batch view becomes pass/fail verdict. | Emit census/listing only; no green rollup, no "all rows passed", no ladder completion claim. |
| Bounded source row becomes Commissioning Gate or Decision Frame. | Carry missing commissioned-capture inputs as visible stop or limitation. |
| Judgment conductor pattern imports Judgment authority. | Cite Judgment only for no-authority routing discipline. |

## Output Boundary

Allowed future output, if separately authorized, is a state census over existing
rows and packets. It may say what was inspectable, missing, limited, suggested,
or waiting for operator finalization.

It must not say the source-quality batch is validated, ready, admitted,
complete, scored, Judgment-useful, buyer-proof, or commercially ready.

## Non-Claims

This artifact is not validation, readiness, source completeness proof, fixture
admission, rights clearance, retention policy, sensitivity review, source-access
boundary amendment, source discovery, runner dispatch authorization, API
authorization, crawler authorization, browser fallback authorization,
source-quality scoring, credibility assessment, inclusion/exclusion advice, ECR
design, Cleaning implementation, Judgment scoring, buyer proof, or
commercial-readiness evidence.
