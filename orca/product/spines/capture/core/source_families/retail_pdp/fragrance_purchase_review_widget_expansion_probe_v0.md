# Fragrance Purchase-Review Widget Expansion Probe v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Capture widget-route probe receipt / fragrance purchase-review lane
scope: Records the bounded review-widget probe over the five locked fragrance purchase-review fixtures, including pagination, rating-filter, media-filter, and source-route findings.
use_when:
  - Deciding whether to use direct review-widget endpoints instead of rendered PDP packets for the five locked fragrance review fixtures.
  - Checking how to get month/rating/media/verified fields for candidate review-row filtering.
  - Diagnosing why review media was not found in the current fixture set.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only; no live capture authorization, crawler, Attachment Record writer, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, pain/pleasure labeling, integrity scoring, or source-wide completeness claim.

stale_if:
  - Any widget endpoint, product id, Shopify shop domain, app key, or response shape changes.
  - A fixture is replaced or a review count changes materially.
  - A row adapter physicalizes widget responses into durable Attachment Records.
  - A later probe finds source-visible review media on these fixtures.
  - The focused review-coverage MGT policy changes row-selection or receipt
    expectations for this lane.
```

## Decision

Use direct review-widget routes for all five locked fragrance purchase-review fixtures: Judge.me for Ministry, Luckyscent, Twisted Lily, and Indigo; Yotpo v3 storefront for ZGO.

This is the smallest complete MGT/SCI move: it upgrades row access, pagination, rating filters, verified flags, dates, and media diagnostics without creating a standing crawler, durable Attachment Records, source-wide archive, review-integrity scorer, or pain/pleasure labeling lane.

## Widget Route Results

| Source | Widget route result | Fixture coverage result | Media result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ministry of Scent | Judge.me endpoint works when keyed to `tigerlily-perfume.myshopify.com`, product id `451146516`. | Confirms 4 total rows; page 2 returns no rows; rating filters work. | `with_pictures` returns 0; no real review media images found. |
| Luckyscent / Scent Bar | Judge.me endpoint works when keyed to `lucky-scent-site.myshopify.com`, product id `8675663642945`; public `www.luckyscent.com` key returned 404. | Page 2 returns the 4 rows missing from the rendered page-1 packet; fixture total is 14. Rating filters work for 2, 3, 4, and 5 star rows. | `with_pictures` returns 0; no source-visible review media for this fixture. |
| Twisted Lily | Judge.me endpoint works for product id `7457873363002`; response shape is widget JSON with `reviews`, not HTML. | Page 2 with `per_page=5` returns the 1 missing row; fixture total is 6. Rating filters work for 3, 4, and 5 star rows. | `with_pictures` returns 0; `photo_gallery` is false; per-review picture/video arrays are empty. |
| ZGO Perfumery | Yotpo v3 storefront endpoint works when `store` is the source-visible Yotpo app key/guid `LotcNgdZUJLtOh7iQPZPMJPRTLfGpWs2nlS5U8eh` and `product` is the Shopify product id `10788875403567`. Older Yotpo v1 widget endpoints remain row-empty for this fixture. | Confirms 1 total row, native review id, source date, verified-buyer flag, 5-star distribution, and 5.0 average rating. Rating/media filters work via POST body, not GET query params. | Review row has empty image/video arrays; `reviewsMedia` total is 0. |
| Indigo Perfumery | Judge.me endpoint works when keyed to `indigo-perfumery.myshopify.com`, product id `1243179588`; public `indigoperfumery.com` also worked for page 1. | Page 1 returns 10 rows and page 2 returns 3 rows; fixture total is 13. This supersedes the earlier schema-only row-completeness path, while the visible PDP still lacks obvious widget controls. | `with_pictures` returns 0; no real review media images found. |

## Public Judge.me Request Shape

The working endpoint is:

```text
GET https://api.judge.me/reviews/reviews_for_widget
```

Working parameters:

```text
url=<Shopify.shop domain or accepted public domain>
shop_domain=<same domain>
platform=shopify
product_id=<source-visible Shopify product id>
page=<1-based page>
per_page=<widget page size>
sort_by=<optional sort key>
sort_dir=<optional direction>
filter_rating=<optional 1..5 star filter>
```

Observed sort/filter posture:

| Need | Observed parameter |
| --- | --- |
| Most recent window | Default page order, or `sort_by=created_at&sort_dir=desc` where the legacy widget honors it. |
| Lowest rating | `sort_by=rating&sort_dir=asc`. |
| Pictures only | `sort_by=with_pictures`. |
| Pictures first | `sort_by=pictures_first`. |
| Exact rating bucket | `filter_rating=1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, or `5`. |

Month windows are not a server-side widget filter in this probe. Derive
`review_month` mechanically from source-visible review dates after capture.

## Public Yotpo v3 Request Shape

The working ZGO endpoint is:

```text
GET https://api-cdn.yotpo.com/v3/storefront/store/<YOTPO_GUID>/product/<SHOPIFY_PRODUCT_ID>/reviews?page=1&perPage=10
```

For the locked ZGO fixture:

```text
YOTPO_GUID=LotcNgdZUJLtOh7iQPZPMJPRTLfGpWs2nlS5U8eh
SHOPIFY_PRODUCT_ID=10788875403567
```

Companion endpoints:

```text
GET https://api-cdn.yotpo.com/v3/storefront/store/<YOTPO_GUID>/product/<SHOPIFY_PRODUCT_ID>/ratings
GET https://api-cdn.yotpo.com/v3/storefront/stores/<YOTPO_GUID>/products/<SHOPIFY_PRODUCT_ID>/reviewsMedia?page=1&perPage=10
```

Server-side review filters use POST to the same reviews path with a JSON body:

```json
{"scores":[5]}
{"scores":[1]}
{"pictured":true}
```

Observed ZGO fixture validation:

| Field | Observed |
| --- | --- |
| `pagination.total` | `1` |
| `bottomline.totalReview` / `averageScore` | `1` / `5.0` |
| native review id | Present |
| review created field | Present as datetime |
| verified buyer | `true` |
| review body word count | `99` |
| score distribution | 5-star: 1; 1/2/3/4-star: 0 |
| review media | image count 0, video count 0, `reviewsMedia.total=0` |

Do not use the older Yotpo v1 route for ZGO row completion:

```text
GET https://api-cdn.yotpo.com/v1/widget/<YOTPO_GUID>/products/<PRODUCT_ID>/reviews.json
```

That route recognized the product mapping but returned zero reviews/bottomline for the observed fixture.

## Media Diagnosis

The current lack of review media is source data, not only extractor weakness, for the locked fixtures:

- Ministry, Luckyscent, and Indigo returned zero rows for `with_pictures`.
- Twisted Lily returned zero rows for `with_pictures`, `photo_gallery=false`, and empty per-review picture/video arrays.
- ZGO Yotpo v3 returned one review row with empty image/video arrays, and the `reviewsMedia` endpoint returned total 0. The older v1 widget endpoint is not a reliable media or row route for this fixture.
- Product PDP gallery images are not review media and must not satisfy `media_attached_flag`.

## Steps Performed

1. Read the current five-site registry, row contract, and row-capture pilot receipt.
2. Inspected preserved packet DOM/raw bodies for widget vendors, product ids, page controls, sort controls, and Shopify shop domains.
3. Fetched the public Judge.me scripts and derived the actual request shape from `jdgm.shopParams()`, `jdgm.ajaxParamsFor()`, pagination setup, and sort/filter handlers.
4. Ran bounded `curl_cffi` live probes against public Judge.me and Yotpo widget endpoints at human-scale request volume.
5. After ZGO v1 Yotpo routes returned zero rows, fetched the Yotpo loader/runtime assets and derived the current v3 storefront endpoint shape.
6. Validated ZGO v3 product reviews, ratings, media, and POST filter bodies with body-free summaries.
7. Saved raw widget responses only under ignored `_test_runs/` paths because they contain review bodies.
8. Parsed body-free summaries for status code, response shape, total count, page count, row count, native review id presence, rating filter behavior, verified fields, date fields, and media indicators.

Do not move the raw `.raw.txt` widget responses into tracked docs.

## Accepted Residuals

- No durable Attachment Records or production row adapter were built.
- No full source-wide review archives were created; counts are fixture-level widget totals observed during this probe.
- No review body text is committed in tracked docs.
- ZGO remains a low-volume fixture with only one observed review row; the old v1 Yotpo API mismatch is explained by the current widget using v3 storefront routes, not by source-wide ZGO absence.
- Comment scope, pain/pleasure, integrity, authenticity, and buyer-proof interpretation remain downstream lanes.
- Scent-profile tagging is intentionally not part of the capture row/filter contract unless the source explicitly displays it as source-visible review metadata.
