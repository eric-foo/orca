This directory is the current Capture home for Retail/PDP source-family
artifacts. It does not imply a Scanning sibling exists.

Phase sibling status: no accepted
`orca/product/spines/scanning/source_families/retail_pdp/` directory exists in
this worktree. If a Scanning Retail/PDP source family is later created, add the
cross-pointer here and in the Scanning family entrypoint.
