# Fragrance Purchase-Review Focused Coverage MGT v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Capture operating target / focused review-coverage MGT receipt
scope: Defines the mini god-tier focused review coverage shape for fragrance purchase-review rows, anchored by the Luckyscent pinned Judge.me route probe and adaptable to widget or PDP drift.
use_when:
  - Building or reviewing the first focused review-row adapter for Luckyscent.
  - Deciding which purchase-review rows should enter a bounded reader corpus without capturing every public row.
  - Porting the focused review-coverage shape to other locked fragrance purchase-review sources.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only; no live capture authorization, crawler, durable Attachment Record writer, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, pain/pleasure labeling, review-integrity scoring, or source-wide completeness claim.

stale_if:
  - The Luckyscent pinned product, Shopify product id, Judge.me shop domain, widget endpoint, response shape, or aggregate PDP JSON-LD shape changes.
  - A later owner decision asks for full public review archives instead of focused review coverage.
  - Durable Attachment Record physicalization or review-body storage policy changes the row lifecycle.
  - A production adapter implements a different selection policy, cap, or coverage receipt.
```

## Decision

The mini god-tier version of fragrance purchase-review capture is **Focused
Review Coverage**, not "all public review rows."

The target is enough row diversity and source-visible metadata for a downstream
reader to interpret product-related pain points, pleasure points, and review-data
integrity without turning the lane into a full crawler or a context-window dump.

The focused corpus must include:

- aggregate product review context when source-visible;
- native review ids or candidate-key basis;
- rating, month, body-length bucket, media, verified-purchase, and source-app or
  transparency fields where source-visible;
- a selected row set biased toward 1-star, 4-star, media, long, and recent rows;
- a skipped-row receipt so omissions are visible; and
- accepted residuals explaining what the focused set deliberately leaves out.

## Luckyscent Pinned Route Probe

Target product:

```text
https://www.luckyscent.com/products/memoirs-of-a-trespasser-by-imaginary-authors
```

Pinned row route:

```text
GET https://api.judge.me/reviews/reviews_for_widget
url=lucky-scent-site.myshopify.com
shop_domain=lucky-scent-site.myshopify.com
platform=shopify
product_id=8675663642945
page=<1-based page>
per_page=<page size>
filter_rating=<optional 1..5>
sort_by=<optional sort key>
sort_dir=<optional direction>
```

Observed companion aggregate route:

- PDP JSON-LD `ProductGroup.aggregateRating` exposes `ratingValue=3.71`,
  `reviewCount=14`, `bestRating=5`, and `worstRating=1`.
- The Judge.me widget route exposes `total_count=14` but does not expose the
  average rating in the observed response body.

Ignored local probe receipts:

```

Raw `.raw.txt` files in the same ignored folder contain review bodies and must
not be moved into tracked docs.

## Observed Coverage Receipt

The pinned Luckyscent route returned 14 deduped review rows for the fixture.

| Field | Observed |
| --- | --- |
| Aggregate average rating | `3.71` from PDP JSON-LD |
| Aggregate review count | `14` from PDP JSON-LD and Judge.me `total_count` |
| Rating distribution | 2-star: 2; 3-star: 4; 4-star: 4; 5-star: 4; 1-star: 0 |
| Month range | 2017-12 through 2026-04 |
| Recent observed months | 2025-12: 2 rows; 2026-04: 1 row |
| Body-length buckets | `<20`: 2; `20_39`: 3; `40_74`: 5; `75_plus`: 4 |
| Native review ids | Present on all 14 rows |
| Verified-buyer true | 3 rows |
| Review media | 0 rows by real picture/video container scan |
| Source media filter | `with_pictures` returned 0 rows |

Focused selection under the current policy selected 10 rows and skipped 4 rows.

| Selection view | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Selected rows | 10 |
| Selected 2-star rows | 2 |
| Selected 3-star rows | 1 |
| Selected 4-star rows | 4 |
| Selected 5-star rows | 3 |
| Selected rows with native ids | 10 |
| Selected verified-buyer rows | 3 |
| Selected media-attached rows | 0 |
| Skipped rows | 4 |

The four skipped rows were lower-priority context rows under the focused policy:
three short or mid-length 3-star rows and one older 40-to-74-word 5-star row.
Their existence remains visible in the skipped-row receipt; they are not silently
erased.

## Focused Selection Policy

The first implementation should capture all row metadata in the bounded widget
window, but only pass a focused subset of review bodies to downstream readers
when context is tight.

Always select:

- all 1-star rows;
- all 4-star rows;
- all rows with source-visible review media;
- all rows with `review_body_word_count >= 75`;
- recent low-rating rows, including 2-star rows when no 1-star rows exist.

Usually select:

- 5-star rows when recent or `review_body_word_count >= 75`;
- 2-star and 3-star controls when recent or `review_body_word_count >= 75`;
- `40_74` rows when they add rating balance, verified-purchase evidence, media,
  or recency.

Usually skip from the reader body set, while retaining metadata in the receipt:

- `<20` rows unless they are recent low-rating rows or the product has too few
  rows;
- older `20_39` rows unless needed for rating balance;
- older 5-star rows below the `75_plus` length threshold when the product already has
  enough positive coverage.

Month windows are derived after capture from source-visible review dates. Do not
depend on Judge.me for server-side month filtering in v0.

## Adaptive Cap

The adapter should not hard-code "10 rows" as the permanent target. Use a
budget-aware cap:

1. Capture and normalize the bounded widget window first.
2. Build the coverage receipt from all normalized rows.
3. Select rows in priority order: 1-star, 4-star, media, `75_plus`, recent low
   rating, verified, recent or long 5-star, then recent or long 2/3-star controls.
4. If the selected body set is still too large, keep the highest-priority rows
   by rating diversity and recency, but preserve skipped-row counts and reasons.
5. If the fixture is small enough, include all row bodies.

This keeps the operating shape adaptable across small one-row sources such as
the current ZGO fixture and larger sources where all bodies would overflow the
reader context.

## Adapter Shape

The first implementation should be a small adapter with replaceable route
modules, not a retailer-specific one-off parser.

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `SourceRouteProbe` | Resolve the current product route, widget vendor, shop/app key, product id, and endpoint shape from the pinned registry entry and PDP evidence. |
| `ReviewPageFetcher` | Fetch bounded pages and rating/media filter controls at human-scale volume. |
| `AggregateCompanionParser` | Preserve PDP aggregate rating/count separately from row fields. |
| `RowNormalizer` | Normalize native id, rating, timestamp/month, body hash/body pointer, word count, length bucket, verified flag, media flag, helpful counts, transparency/source-app badges, product title/url attrs, and residuals. |
| `FocusedSelector` | Apply the focused selection policy and adaptive cap. |
| `CoverageReceipt` | Emit totals, distributions, selected/skipped counts, route health, and accepted residuals without raw body text in tracked docs. |
| `RouteHealth` | Decide whether to proceed, rederive route parameters, or fall back to rendered capture. |

The row normalizer should rely on native widget data attributes before visible
text. For Luckyscent Judge.me rows, observed useful anchors include
`data-review-id`, `.jdgm-rev__rating[data-score]`, `.jdgm-rev__timestamp`
`data-content`, `data-verified-buyer`, product title/url attributes,
thumb-count attributes, and review-source badge attributes.

## Drift And Fallback Contract

The route is healthy when all of these are true:

- endpoint status is successful;
- response is parseable JSON with an `html` field and `total_count`;
- `.jdgm-rev` rows are present when `total_count > 0`;
- native ids are present or candidate keys can be generated with an explicit
  weaker-key residual;
- rating/date/body fields are recoverable from source-visible row material; and
- media diagnostics distinguish real review media from generic product, avatar,
  star, or tracking images.

If the route changes:

| Failure signature | Next move |
| --- | --- |
| Widget endpoint 404 or empty, but PDP loads | Re-derive `shop_domain`, product id, and Judge.me config from PDP scripts, Shopify product JSON, and widget params before changing source status. |
| `product_id` no longer matches | Re-read the pinned PDP for current Shopify product id or variant/product group ids. |
| Widget HTML selector shape changes | Prefer data attributes and native row ids; if row fields are no longer parseable, run a rendered PDP packet as a body-possession fallback. |
| Rating/media filter params stop working | Capture default pages and post-filter locally; record server-filter failure in the receipt. |
| PDP aggregate disappears | Preserve widget `total_count`; mark `aggregate_average_absent` unless a visible PDP aggregate is recovered elsewhere. |
| Media filter and row scan disagree | Trust real review media containers and source media-filter counts, not generic images. Carry `media_diagnostic_mismatch` if unresolved. |
| Known fixture returns zero rows | Re-probe one known-reviewed SKU before downgrading the whole retailer. |

Do not escalate from this adapter into broad product discovery, standing
monitoring, auth bypass, challenge solving, or source-wide crawling.

## Accepted Residuals

| Residual | Why accepted now | Remaining risk | Upgrade trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Not all public review bodies enter the reader set | Focused coverage preserves the rows most likely to carry pain, pleasure, and integrity signals while controlling context. | A skipped row could contain a rare issue. | A product decision requires exhaustive review-language audit, litigation-grade evidence, or model error traces to skipped rows. |
| Fixture-level, not source-wide | The current lane is proving purchase-review capture on bounded fragrance fixtures. | Source-level review behavior may differ across products. | Owner asks for source-wide coverage or a selected source becomes a recurring production source. |
| Widget route is preferred over full rendered PDP | It gives native ids, filters, dates, verified flags, and pagination more cheaply. | PDP-visible presentation could diverge from widget payload. | Widget/PDP total mismatch, row text mismatch, or source display controls become decision-critical. |
| Aggregate average split across PDP and widget | PDP JSON-LD carries average rating; widget carries rows and total count. | If one substrate changes, aggregate context may be partial. | Average rating is missing or conflicts with widget totals on re-probe. |
| No review media on the pinned Luckyscent fixture | Both real media scan and `with_pictures` filter returned zero. | Another product may have media, and media fields remain untested on positive media rows. | A fixture or source with media-positive reviews is selected. |
| No pain/pleasure or integrity labels in capture | Capture should preserve source-visible fields only. | Reader still needs downstream interpretation. | Cleaning/Judgment lane binds label schema and storage. |
| No durable Attachment Records yet | Current raw bodies are ignored scratch outputs. | Reuse depends on local scratch unless a later lane physicalizes storage. | Attachment Record writer/layout is authorized for review rows. |

## Steps Performed

1. Used the existing site registry to pin Luckyscent to the Judge.me route with
   `shop_domain=lucky-scent-site.myshopify.com` and product id `8675663642945`.
2. Fetched the pinned PDP and Judge.me widget pages/filters into ignored scratch
   output.
3. Parsed Judge.me widget JSON and row HTML for native review ids, ratings,
   source timestamps, verified flags, product attrs, helpful counts,
   transparency/source-app badge attributes, body word counts, and real media
   containers.
4. Tested default pagination, exact rating filters, media-oriented sort/filter
   routes, and recent sort controls.
5. Diagnosed media by separating generic images from real review picture/video
   containers and by checking `with_pictures`.
6. Parsed PDP JSON-LD separately to recover aggregate average rating and review
   count.
7. Built a body-free focused selection summary with selected/skipped counts and
   distributions.
8. Kept raw review bodies in ignored `_test_runs/` output only.
