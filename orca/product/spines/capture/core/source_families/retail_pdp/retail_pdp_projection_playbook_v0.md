# Retail/PDP Projection Playbook v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Product playbook (Retail/PDP raw-packet-to-projection contract; non-authorizing)
scope: >
  Stabilizes the Amazon, Sephora, and Ulta Retail/PDP projection slice as a
  repeatable view over Source Capture Packets (CapturePacket): what raw capture must provide,
  what projection may emit, what residuals mean, and which retailer-specific
  target-binding limits must stay visible before ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment consume
  the view.
use_when:
  - Deciding whether Retail/PDP work should proceed through projection playbook, projection wiring, ECR sequencing, or a bounded implementation patch.
  - Checking what Amazon, Sephora, and Ulta PDP projection may carry from raw packets and what it must residualize.
  - Reviewing the current `retail_pdp_mechanical_projection` helper against product/source-capture doctrine.

```

## Decision

The immediate move is **projection playbook first**, not auto-project-after-capture
wiring and not ECR sequencing.

Reason: current code already contains a bounded mechanical helper for Retail/PDP
projection, but the owner-observable contract was scattered across core projection
doctrine, capture recon docs, a rendered-capture spec, and helper tests. Wiring now
would risk converting helper behavior into a hidden product contract, especially
where fallbacks are carried but unsafe, where review counts can come from a
recommendation module, or where a URL/requested SKU differs from the rendered SKU.

This playbook is the contract a wiring or implementation patch must obey. It does
not authorize a runner, schema migration, live capture, ECR production, Cleaning
transform, Judgment read, validation claim, readiness claim, or buyer-proof claim.

## Cynefin Routing

- Regime: **Complicated with a Complex edge**.
- Smallest complete outcome: one retrievable playbook that says what gets captured,
  what projection emits, what residuals mean, and how Amazon/Sephora/Ulta differ.
- Bottleneck: target binding, not raw capture alone. The risky cases are unanchored
  Amazon price fallback, Sephora recommendation-review noise, Ulta LD JSON versus
  Apollo mismatch, and requested SKU versus rendered SKU drift.
- Stop/pivot rule: if this contract conflicts with current code, treat the code as
  implementation reality and the conflict as a bounded patch candidate. Do not hide
  it behind ECR or Cleaning.
- Disallowed next move: auto-ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, or auto-project wiring that
  does not first preserve the projection residuals and binding gaps named here.

## Raw Input Contract

Projection starts only from a preserved `SourceCapturePacket`. Raw remains
canonical; projection is a re-derivable view.

Minimum input for Retail/PDP projection:

| Input | Required posture |
| --- | --- |
| Packet and slice identity | Carry `packet_id`, `slice_id`, source locator, slice locator, series id, locale pin, currency pin, variant pin, capture time, cutoff posture, and archive-history posture when known. Unknowns stay as visible packet facts or projection residuals. |
| Preserved bytes | The helper needs the raw bytes for every `preserved_file_id` it projects. Missing preserved bytes are a hard error, not an empty projection. |
| Rendered DOM | Retail/PDP projection is a rendered/embedded-state slice. If no `.html`/`.htm` DOM file is present for a slice, emit `retail_pdp_rendered_dom_absent` and do not fabricate rows. |
| Visible text | Use only as a source-visible companion to DOM. If a value comes only from position-dependent visible text, carry it with an isolation flag and residual. |
| Structured payloads | Preserve embedded `application/ld+json` and `window.__APOLLO_STATE__` verbatim when present. Parsed values may guide row fields, but raw JSON text remains carried. |
| Capture/recon posture | Capture decides access, tool route, and block limits. Projection must not fetch, retry, bypass, or decide capturability. |

If a Retail/PDP packet was commissioned because Commission Signal Board or
Scanning marked a product URL recent/current-state high-attention, that marker is
projection provenance only. Carry capture time, source-visible state, and
residuals; do not fetch, retry, change access/route posture, or treat
current-state capture as buyer proof or Judgment readiness.

## Projection Output Contract

The current helper emits `RetailPdpProjectionPacket` with:

- `projection_method: retail_pdp_mechanical_projection`;
- `projection_version: v0`;
- `certification: view_only; not_cleaned; not_normalized; not_judgment_ready`;
- `rows[]`;
- `binding_map[]`;
- `loss_ledger`;
- packet-level `residuals[]`.

Allowed row kinds:

| Row kind | Meaning | Not allowed to mean |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `retail_pdp_product` | Product/PDP context and source/slice/cadence pins carried from packet facts. | Product truth, normalized product identity, or cross-retailer equivalence. |
| `retail_variant_offer` | Source-visible variant/offer fields such as SKU/product id, variant name, price, currency, availability, and binding source. | Cleaned offer, trusted price, comparable price series, or buy/sell signal. |
| `retail_review_substrate` | Target review substrate fields such as count/rating/source and substrate conflict markers. | Full review corpus, per-review text rows, review quality, sentiment, demand, or credibility. |
| `retail_embedded_structured_json` | Verbatim embedded JSON text plus parse status and raw anchor. | Parsed ontology authority or cleaned product schema. |
| `retail_carried_module` | Frame-sensitive modules such as shipping, loyalty, and recommendations carried as source-visible modules. | Noise by default, demand signal by default, or salience decision. |

Required binding posture for `structure_preserved = true`:

| Binding | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `sku_variant_price` | SKU/variant/price fields stay bound together at the row that emitted them. |
| `variant_availability` | Availability stays bound to the same SKU/variant row, not to the page as a whole. |
| `review_substrate_for_product` | Review count/rating/substrate source stays bound to the product/PDP row. |
| `series_locale_currency` | Series id, locale, currency, and variant pins stay carried with the offer row. |

Additional bindings such as `structured_json_for_product` and `module_carried`
are useful, but they do not by themselves prove Retail/PDP structure is
preserved.

## Loss And Residual Rules

Projection may collapse only source-envelope PDP chrome that is logged and
raw-anchored, currently:

- `RETAIL_HERO_IMAGERY_COLLAPSED`;
- `RETAIL_CART_NOTIFY_STATE_COLLAPSED`.

Everything else is carry-or-residualize:

| Residual / posture | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `retail_pdp_rendered_dom_absent` | The packet lacks a rendered DOM body for the slice. Projection cannot reconstruct a PDP view. |
| `variant_offer_absent` | The helper did not find source-visible fields sufficient to emit a variant offer row. |
| `review_substrate_absent` | The helper did not find target review substrate fields. |
| `*_malformed_json` | Embedded structured JSON was preserved but could not be parsed. |
| `amazon_price_from_unanchored_visible_text_fallback` | A dollar amount was found only by visible-text fallback. It is carried as unsafe, not trusted as target price. |
| `sephora_review_count_from_unanchored_fallback` | Review count came from a bare visible-text pattern rather than the target "Ratings & Reviews (N)" widget. |
| `sephora_ld_json_review_count_differs_from_target_dom` | LD JSON and target DOM review count disagree. Keep both facts visible. |
| `ulta_ld_json_apollo_*_mismatch` | LD JSON and Apollo state disagree for SKU, product id, price, availability, review count, or rating. Keep both substrates visible. |
| `ulta_requested_sku_rendered_sku_mismatch` | Ulta Apollo requested SKU differs from the rendered SKU. Keep both values visible and do not treat the URL/request parameter as the target-bound SKU. |

Residuals are visible gaps. They are not failures, not suppressions, and not
permission for ECR or Cleaning to author a value from prose.

## Retailer Binding Posture

| Retailer | Capture substrate | Projection binding posture | Residual hard line |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Amazon | Rendered DOM in a US storefront session when commissioned; US storefront pin has a single-probe GO via public delivery ZIP widget, with bot-wall and selector fragility still visible. | Target-anchored ASIN/price/availability/review fields are carried from DOM/visible text. The DOM price input is the target price source when present. Shipping, loyalty, and recommendation modules are carried as frame-sensitive modules. | If price comes only from a visible `$N` fallback, residualize it. Do not let store-card, shipping, or recommendation dollars become target price. Amazon access posture remains the strictest and does not become commercial-scale authority. |
| Sephora | Rendered PDP with Bazaarvoice-backed reviews first-party-rendered after progressive/incremental scroll when review bodies are needed. | Product/variant fields are carried from LD JSON; target review substrate uses the "Ratings & Reviews (N)" widget where present. Recommendation-review counts are carried as examples/noise posture, not target substrate. | A bare "`N Reviews`" count is unanchored fallback and must be residualized. A recommendation card count must not become target review count. Full per-review body rows are not emitted by v0 helper. |
| Ulta | Rendered PDP with embedded `application/ld+json` and `window.__APOLLO_STATE__`. | Preserve both LD JSON and Apollo verbatim. Merge source-visible offer/review fields only when substrates are coherent, residualize LD/Apollo mismatches, and residualize requested-SKU versus rendered-SKU mismatch. Carry `apollo_requested_sku` when present. | Requested-SKU versus rendered-SKU mismatch is a target-binding risk. Do not treat the URL/request parameter as target-bound when the rendered SKU differs. |

## What ECR May Consume

ECR may consume the projection only as source-visible substrate:

- raw anchors;
- row kinds;
- binding map entries;
- source-visible fields;
- loss ledger;
- residuals.

ECR must not consume:

- a missing residual as if it were a value;
- `structure_preserved = true` as proof of Judgment readiness;
- module presence as salience;
- unanchored fallback fields as target-bound facts;
- review-substrate rows as full review corpus rows;
- a projected row as a cleaned, normalized, deduped, or trusted fact.

## Next Move Selector

Use this selector after the playbook:

| If the next goal is... | Correct move |
| --- | --- |
| Owner-observable contract for the slice | This playbook is the artifact. |
| Auto-project after capture | First patch or explicitly accept the remaining target-binding gaps, especially per-review body-row scope. Then wire projection as a view over raw packet output. |
| ECR sequencing | Wait until projection output carries residuals through the ECR handoff. ECR consumes source-visible facts and residuals only; it does not repair projection gaps. |
| Bounded implementation patch | Target one remaining gap: explicit per-review body row support, or runner invocation of the existing helper. Do not combine with ECR or Cleaning work. |

## Non-Claims

This playbook is not validation, readiness, buyer proof, capture authorization,
live-source authorization, commercial scraping authority, ECR design, Cleaning
design, Judgment design, schema ratification, source-quality scoring, fixture
admission, or a claim that the existing Retail/PDP helper is complete. It does
not authorize auto-project-after-capture wiring or implementation work by
itself.

## Direction Change Propagation

```yaml
direction_change_propagation:
  doctrine_changed: >
    The Retail/PDP projection slice now has a retrievable product playbook that
    binds the existing `retail_pdp_mechanical_projection` helper to the core
    projection doctrine, names Amazon/Sephora/Ulta target-binding posture, and
    records that playbook-first is the correct next move before auto-project
    wiring or ECR sequencing.
