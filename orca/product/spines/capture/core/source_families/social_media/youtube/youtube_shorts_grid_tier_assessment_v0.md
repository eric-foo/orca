# YouTube Shorts Grid-Tier Assessment v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: live_probe_assessment_receipt
scope: >
  Assessment (not implementation) of the YouTube Shorts channel grid as the
  cheap DAILY capture tier under the owner's 2026-07-02 two-tier daily-cadence
  direction, with a code/artifact comparison against the IG /reels/ grid and
  TikTok profile-grid capture surfaces, and an owner-directed follow-up probe
  of the public channel RSS feed surface (exact views/dates/likes). Records
  observed per-item fields, route viability logged-out, per-video view-capture
  proof, gaps, and a cheap-tier shape recommendation feeding the owner fork.
  Commissioned by docs/workflows/yt_shorts_grid_tier_assessment_handoff_v0.md.
use_when:
  - Deciding the per-platform shape of the daily grid capture tier
    (views-only vs engagement-bearing vs unusable).
  - Checking what the YT Shorts grid exposed per tile logged-out on the probe
    date, and how that compares to IG/TT grid surfaces in existing capture code.
stale_if:
  - A later YT grid or RSS-feed probe observes different fields, depth, access
    posture, or wall behavior.
  - The IG reels-grid or TikTok capture modules materially change what their
    grid surfaces expose.
  - The owner revisits the two-tier daily-cadence direction.

## Recommendation (feeds the owner fork; does not resolve it)

**Revised after the owner-directed Run 3 (RSS surface): the recommended cheap
daily YT monitor is the public channel RSS feed, with the Shorts grid demoted
to enumeration/backfill/fallback.** Per roster channel per day, one logged-out
~18-53 KB XML fetch (`youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC…`) yields the
15 most recent uploads with EXACT view counts, EXACT publish timestamps, and
like counts (starRating; validated against watch-page likes) — strictly richer
and ~60x cheaper than the grid page, whose tiles carry only rounded view text.
Every new upload enters the feed regardless of format, so new-Shorts detection
is complete at daily cadence; the grid's remaining jobs are the Shorts-vs-video
classification of new IDs, catalog enumeration/backfill beyond the feed's
15-entry window (48 tiles/fetch), and fallback if a feed misbehaves. Comment
counts exist on NO cheap logged-out YT batch surface (feed schema carries
none; grid tiles carry none) — they stay deep-tier, or the official Data API
(an owner fork: new credential + API-declared provenance). The owner's YT
trigger is a VIEW spike, which the feed serves with exact numbers.

The original grid-only finding stands unchanged beneath this: if only the grid
is used, it is views-only (option (a) of the commissioning packet's fork). IG
and TT grid surfaces ARE engagement-bearing in our existing capture paths
(views + likes + comments per item), so their richer view/like/comment spike
rule is feasible from grid tier alone.

Spike thresholds, rounded-vs-exact spike semantics, and daily-cadence
scheduling remain owner decisions and are not resolved here.

## Probe Method And Authorization

- Authorization: owner direction 2026-07-02 authorizes assessment probes
  (verbatim quote carried in the handoff packet, verified before probing).
- Probe vehicle: adapted the enumeration/wall-detection/pacing posture of
  `orca-harness/youtube_capture/shorts_scroll_capture_v0.py` (blob `a80bf567`
  @ `origin/main cf43db5f`, re-verified) into a scratch read-only probe script;
  no repo code changed, no producer built.
- Wire posture: the harness's own `stealth_client.http_get`
  (backend observed: `curl_cffi:chrome`), logged-out, no cookies or session.
- Bound: 3 admitted roster channels (from the read-only linkage ledger, blob
  `e8d35b5c` re-verified), channel-id URLs (`/channel/<UC…>/shorts` — ledger
  handles are capture labels, not guaranteed-current handles), 5 HTTP requests
  total (3 grid + 2 watch), ~12 s pacing, stop-on-first-wall.
- Wall outcome: **no wall signals** — all requests HTTP 200, no
  `consent.youtube.com` redirect, no "Sign in to confirm you" interstitial.
- Two runs, same bound (5 requests each). Run 1 (targeted extraction,
  scratch-only): 2026-07-02T16:19:27Z–16:20:17Z. Run 2 (full-fidelity,
  owner-requested, committed to the lake): 2026-07-02T16:36:10Z–16:36:59Z.
  See "Run 2: Full-Fidelity Evidence Commit" below for the durable raw
  evidence; the load-bearing observations are inlined throughout.

## Observed: YT Shorts channel grid, logged-out

| Channel (roster id) | Channel ID | HTTP | Tiles in initial HTML | Renderer | Continuation markers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| JeremyFragrance (acct_yt_fragrance_011) | UCzKrJ5NSA9o7RHYRG12kHZw | 200 | 48 | `shortsLockupViewModel` | present |
| GentsScents (acct_yt_fragrance_010) | UC9IImcLkUdmURWtQhxu8VwQ | 200 | 13 | `shortsLockupViewModel` | present |
| Redolessence (acct_yt_fragrance_018) | UCuSy0Z5UwvkMQ7lXRbUdOnQ | 200 | 48 | `shortsLockupViewModel` | present |

Per-tile fields actually observed (tile = `richGridRenderer.contents[].
richItemRenderer.content.shortsLockupViewModel`; top-level keys:
`accessibilityText, entityId, indexInCollection, inlinePopStateEntityKey,
loggingDirectives, menuOnTap, menuOnTapA11yLabel, onTap, overlayMetadata,
stackedFrameData, thumbnailViewModel, titleTruncationStyle`):

- **video_id**: present per tile (48/48, 13/13, 48/48 tiles carried one).
- **title**: present (overlay metadata + accessibility text).
- **view count**: present per tile as ROUNDED display text only — observed
  values like `834 views`, `1.5K views`, `5.2K views`, `241K views`. Below ~1K
  the display text is unit-precise (`834 views`); at K/M scale it is
  quantized to 2 significant figures.
- **likes**: ABSENT — no like field or like-bearing string in any tile.
- **comments**: ABSENT — no comment field or comment-bearing string in any tile.
- **publish date / recency**: ABSENT — no date, "ago", or recency string in
  any tile. Grid order is the only recency signal on this surface; first-seen
  tracking or the deep tier must supply publish timing.
- **thumbnail**: present (`thumbnailViewModel`), not evaluated further.

Tile-count note: regex short-id extraction and tile-renderer count agreed
exactly per channel (48/13/48), so the tile payload is the same population the
existing enumeration route sees. Whether GentsScents' 13 tiles is that
channel's full Shorts count or an initial-page cap was not determined (out of
probe bounds); continuation requests exist for deeper history and were
deliberately not exercised.

## Per-Video View Capture Proof (grid vs deep tier, same videos)

| Video | Grid display text (tile) | Watch-page exact count | Watch-page source path |
|---|---|---|---|
| iG92pxnu7J4 | `1.5K views` | 1,597 | `ytInitialPlayerResponse.videoDetails.viewCount` |
| vwT__IK7XGU | `5.2K views` | 5,263 | `ytInitialPlayerResponse.videoDetails.viewCount` |

Per-video view capture from the grid is proven, with the exactness caveat:
grid views are display-rounded; the deep (watch-packet) tier remains the
exact-count source. Any YT view-spike rule computed on grid values operates on
quantized numbers (e.g. a 1.5K→1.6K step is the smallest observable move at
that scale). Whether that quantization is acceptable for the spike trigger is
an owner product-parameter decision, surfaced here and not resolved.

## Run 2: Full-Fidelity Evidence Commit (owner-requested)

Everything capturable from the probe surfaces is persisted raw in the lake as
one SourceCapturePacket (probe-scoped surface; every existing YouTube consumer
filters on `source_surface` and skips it, verified in
`youtube_watch_packet_metric_document.py` / `behavioral_projection.py`):

- Lake packet: `raw/f16/01KWHV1Q2E48SS4A9QXGRR90B5` (`ORCA_DATA_ROOT` =
  `F:\orca-data-lake`), `source_family: youtube`,
  `source_surface: yt_shorts_channel_grid_probe_v0`.
- Contents (12 staged artifacts + writer manifest/receipt): per channel the
  raw served grid HTML, the FULL parsed `ytInitialData`, and the COMPLETE
  tile renderer JSON; per comparison video the raw watch-page HTML; plus the
  probe manifest with per-request status, final URL, byte size, sha256,
  timestamps.
- Raw sha256 anchors: grid JeremyFragrance `f19e5bf8…`, grid GentsScents
  `202f7dc8…`, grid Redolessence `676da6b8…`, watch iG92pxnu7J4 `94f60d39…`,
  watch vwT__IK7XGU `cd89d15a…` (full hashes in the packet's
  `probe_manifest.json`).
- Run 2 reproduced Run 1: same tile counts (48/13/48), zero wall signals,
  views-only tile fields. Date-absence strengthened: a key scan over the
  three COMPLETE persisted tile payloads (all 109 tiles) found zero
  date-bearing keys (`publishedTimeText`/`publishDate`/`dateText`/
  `uploadDate`) — publish timing is definitively not on this surface.
- Deep-tier date proof: both watch pages expose exact `publishDate`
  (iG92pxnu7J4: `2026-07-02T02:00:05-07:00`; vwT__IK7XGU:
  `2026-07-02T01:57:35-07:00`) — publish timing is a deep-tier field.
- Incidental spike-relevant observation: between runs (~17 min), exact watch
  views moved 1,597 → 1,658 and 5,263 → 5,940 on these same-day-published
  Shorts; the grid's rounded text ("1.5K"/"5.2K" at Run 1) is the coarse
  signal a grid-tier spike rule would see.

## Run 3: RSS Feed Surface (owner-directed follow-up)

The owner asked whether the missing metrics could come from another cheap
surface; the public channel RSS feed was probed (1 discovery request) and then
validated (4 roster feeds, ~12 s pacing, zero walls, raw XML preserved).

- Lake packet: `raw/1c8/01KWHWAB07R3PG1WP0VHM1HP7A`,
  `source_surface: yt_channel_rss_feed_probe_v0` (probe-scoped; skipped by all
  existing consumers). Contents: 4 raw feed XMLs + parsed summary with
  per-entry values and sha256s.
- **Uniform across all 4 roster feeds** (JeremyFragrance, GentsScents,
  Redolessence, Cubaknow): 15 entries each; 15/15 with exact integer
  `media:statistics views`; 15/15 with `media:starRating count`; 15/15 with
  exact `published` timestamps; **zero comment-bearing fields** in any raw XML
  (regex scan over the full documents).
- **starRating count = like count, validated**: against the Run-2 persisted
  watch pages (zero extra requests), iG92pxnu7J4 watch `likeCount` 40 (16:36Z)
  vs feed starRating 42 (~16:50Z); vwT__IK7XGU 347 vs 355 — consistent with
  like accrual on same-day videos. The owner manually re-checked vwT__IK7XGU
  later and observed 366 (secondary report, consistent trajectory).
- **Exact-date cross-validation**: feed `published` for iG92pxnu7J4
  (`2026-07-02T09:00:05+00:00`) equals the watch page's `publishDate`
  (`2026-07-02T02:00:05-07:00`).
- **Freshness**: the feed carried a video published ~3 h before Run 2
  (egy7B9shReU) that the Run-2 grid capture did not yet show.
- **Format-mix nuance, measured**: feed↔grid-tile overlap was 12/15
  (JeremyFragrance), 12/15 (Redolessence), but **0/15 for GentsScents** —
  its 13 Shorts are old and its recent 15 uploads are all long-form. This
  confirms the feed is a NEW-uploads window: it misses old Shorts catalogs
  (irrelevant for monitoring; nothing new to detect) and covers every new
  upload of any format (the monitoring case). New feed IDs need a
  Shorts-vs-video classification step — grid membership or the
  spike-triggered deep fetch resolves it.
- Prior art check: no RSS route exists anywhere in the harness or capture
  doctrine (repo sweep); the only mention is an aside in
  `orca-harness/source_capture/transcript/asr_packet.py` that publish timing
  is "available via the caption/RSS path". This surface is new to the lane.

## Comparison: IG /reels/ grid (code + committed-artifact read; not probed)

Basis: `orca-harness/source_capture/ig_reels_grid_capture.py` (blob `51f18fab`),
`orca-harness/runners/run_source_capture_ig_reels_grid_packet.py` (blob
`339f18d8`), `orca-harness/source_capture/ig_reels_grid.py`, all re-verified at
`origin/main cf43db5f`.

- Access posture: logged-out headless-browser page load of
  `instagram.com/<handle>/reels/`; one page load, no item fan-out; passive
  page-load JSON preserved (`clips/user`, `web_profile_info`, profile feed).
- Per-item fields (joined by shortcode from passive JSON):
  **view/play count** (`video_or_play_count` from
  `play_count`/`video_view_count`/`view_count`/`ig_play_count` keys),
  **like_count**, **comment_count**, taken-at timestamp, pinned flags.
  DOM tiles additionally carry per-tile numeric display text.
- Profile-level: follower_count and profile metadata from `web_profile_info`.
- Registry state: IG metrics are already grid-fed via this path (grid →
  projection → producer); honest per-row gap postures (`no_passive_json_join_
  for_shortcode` etc.) are recorded rather than zero-filled.
- Consequence: the owner's IG spike rule (view / like / comment) is satisfiable
  from the existing grid tier alone.

## Comparison: TikTok profile grid (code + committed-artifact read; not probed)

Basis: `orca-harness/runners/run_source_capture_tiktok_video_packet.py` (blob
`e0c10ad7`, re-verified), `orca-harness/source_capture/tiktok/admission.py`,
`batch_packet.py`, `live_batch_probe.py`, and the committed receipt
`docs/workflows/tiktok_sessioned_profile_grid_dom_receipt_v0.md`.

- Access posture: SESSIONED (dedicated non-personal account, human login) per
  the committed N=1 receipt; the lean runner consumes page-owned artifacts
  rather than automating TikTok. This differs from YT/IG's logged-out posture.
- Per-item fields (profile grid feed `/api/post/item_list/`, `stats`/`statsV2`):
  **playCount**, **diggCount** (likes), **commentCount**, **shareCount**,
  **collectCount**, plus createTime. Fully engagement-bearing per item.
- Registry state: zero TT accounts in the roster (none added by this lane);
  grid depth/scale beyond N=1 remains an open residual per the receipt.
- Consequence: the owner's TT spike rule (view / like / comment) is
  satisfiable from the grid surface the existing code already parses, subject
  to the sessioned posture and unmeasured depth/scale.

## Cross-Platform Grid-Tier Summary

| Surface | Access posture | Views/item | Likes/item | Comments/item | Publish timing/item | Evidence basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| YT `@channel/shorts` grid | logged-out HTTP | Yes (rounded text) | No | No | No (grid order only) | live probe (this doc) |
| YT channel RSS feed (15 newest uploads) | logged-out HTTP (XML) | Yes (exact) | Yes (starRating, validated) | No | Yes (exact) | live probe, 4 roster feeds (this doc) |
| IG `/reels/` grid | logged-out browser + passive JSON | Yes (numeric) | Yes | Yes | Yes (taken_at) | code + committed captures |
| TT profile grid | sessioned | Yes (numeric) | Yes (digg) | Yes | Yes (createTime) | code + committed receipt |

## Cost Shape (arithmetic projection, not a validated claim)

One logged-out HTTP GET per channel per day covers that channel's most-recent
Shorts tiles (up to 48 observed) with per-video views — versus one watch-page
fetch PER VIDEO on the deep tier. For the current 30-channel YT roster at the
probe's 12–15 s pacing, a daily grid sweep is ~30 requests over ~6–8 minutes.
This is arithmetic from the probe's per-request observations; a full-roster
sweep was NOT run (out of this lane's bounds) and no operating-envelope claim
is made.

## Gaps, Risks, And Honest Limits

- **Rounded grid views**: K/M-scale quantization bounds the smallest
  observable view delta; spike semantics on rounded values are an owner call.
  Never precision-inflate grid values into exact counts. (Mooted for the
  monitor role if the RSS surface is adopted — feed views are exact.)
- **RSS residuals**: the feed window is the 15 newest uploads mixed across
  formats (new-ID Shorts classification needed; measured 0/15 Shorts overlap
  on a long-form-recent channel); starRating=likes validated on N=2 videos;
  feed behavior verified on N=4 roster channels on one day; no comment counts
  on this or any cheap logged-out YT batch surface (deep tier or the official
  Data API — an owner fork — are the only comment-count routes).
- **No per-tile publish date on YT**: new-content detection must rely on grid
  order + first-seen diffing against prior captures, or defer timing to the
  deep tier.
- **Tile depth**: 48 tiles max observed per initial fetch; older history needs
  continuation requests (existence recorded; deliberately not exercised or
  built).
- **N=3 probe**: route viability is proven on 3 roster channels on one day
  under `curl_cffi:chrome`; logged-out posture can change on YouTube's side at
  any time. The existing stop-on-first-wall discipline should carry into any
  future producer.
- **Handle currency**: probing by channel-id URL avoided the ledger's
  handles-are-labels caveat; a producer should do the same.
- **TT posture asymmetry**: TT grid richness is real but sits behind a
  sessioned route with unmeasured depth/scale; do not treat the three
  platforms' grid tiers as posture-equivalent.

## Non-Claims

- Not an implementation, producer, Silver lane, registry change, or scheduler.
- Not a spike-threshold decision or spike-rule design.
- Not validation, readiness, acceptance, or an operating-envelope claim.
- Not proof the YT grid route will keep working logged-out.
- Not a full-roster sweep, not IG/TT live probes, not TT roster admission.
- The linkage ledger and observation ledger were read-only inputs; no ledger
  edits.
