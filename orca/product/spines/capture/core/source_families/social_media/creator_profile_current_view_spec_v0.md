# Creator Profile Current View Spec v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: source_capture_family_architecture_contract
scope: >
  Owner-directed architecture contract for the current creator profile view: a
  one-stop operator/dashboard surface that joins channel-neutral public account
  subjects, optional public-handle identity linkage, per-content metric
  observations, aggregate metric rollups, and ideal-audience profile snapshots
  without turning the identity ledger into one giant ledger.
  This is not runtime storage, not SQLite adoption, not a live dashboard, not
  capture execution, and not a public person-level product surface.
use_when:
  - Designing the one-stop creator/account profile surface for internal creator intelligence.
  - Deciding where average views, engagement rate, and other aggregate creator metrics belong.
  - Checking the boundary between the public-handle identity ledger, metric observations, metric rollups, ideal-audience enrichment, and future SQLite/data-lake storage.

  - The creator public-handle linkage ledger moves to SQLite or another database schema.
  - A later accepted artifact defines a different creator profile view, dashboard contract, or creator-intelligence surface without explicitly reconciling with this spec and the Creator Signal surface.
  - Metric rollup storage, ideal-audience schema home, or Data Lake physicalization is adopted in a way that supersedes this view contract.
  - The wind-caller carve-out changes public stats, aggregate audience, or person-level surface boundaries.

## Status

`OWNER_DIRECTED_TARGET_VIEW_CONTRACT_V0`.

The owner accepted the split: not one giant ledger; individual reels/videos and
their metrics belong in metric observation records; average/aggregate influence
belongs in rollups; the operator needs a one-stop current profile that can later
become a dashboard.

The owner later accepted the channel-neutral correction: any supported public
platform account may seed the current profile before cross-platform linkage.
`creator_record_id` is earned only after public-handle linkage evidence joins at
least two platforms.

This document records the target view and placement. It does not add real
creator rows, choose SQLite, create runtime tables, authorize live capture,
start a data-lake job, or claim validation/readiness.

## Placement Decision

The one-stop creator profile contract lives at the social-media source-family
level:

`orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_families/social_media/creator_profile_current_view_spec_v0.md`

Why this home:

- The current profile joins Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and later social creator
  inputs, so it does not belong inside the IG-only folder.
- It is a product/source-family contract, so it belongs under `orca/product/`,
  not `docs/hygiene/` or `docs/workflows/`.
- It is not runtime storage, so it does not belong in `orca-harness/`.
- It references Data Lake storage and future SQLite physicalization, but those
  are implementation/storage homes; they are not the source of truth for this
  product view contract.

The public-handle identity ledger remains at:

`orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_families/social_media/creator_public_handle_linkage_ledger_v0.json`

A future static/manual creator-profile artifact, if needed before SQLite, should
live beside this spec, for example:

`orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_families/social_media/creator_profile_current_view_v0.json`

That future artifact should be derived from source-backed identity, metric, and
audience records. It should not be manually edited as a second source of truth
once a data-lake/SQLite physicalization exists.

## Architecture Result

Use a **view over siblings**, not one giant ledger.

```text
creator_public_handle_linkage_ledger
  -> stable public creator/account cluster ids
  -> platform accounts and link evidence

creator_metric_observations
  -> individual reels/videos/profile metric facts
  -> value + posture + source pointer + content/account key

creator_metric_rollups
  -> average views, engagement rate, velocity, cadence
  -> computed over windows from metric observations

creator_ideal_audience_profile_snapshots
  -> ideal/content-fit audience fields and evidence pointers
  -> actual audience remains not_estimated unless separately authorized

creator_profile_current
  -> current one-stop joined view for one platform_account or linked creator_record
```

The first three layers keep truth and provenance separate. The last layer is the
surface the operator opens.

## Core / Satellite Boundary

Core identity spine:

- `platform_account_id` is the always-present join key for public account-level
  observations, metric observations, and account-level metric rollups.
- `creator_record_id` from the public-handle linkage ledger is optional until
  at least two platform accounts are linked by evidence. It is the join key for
  linked creator-cluster views only.
- Identity rows record account linkage evidence only.
- Identity rows must not absorb metric values, audience labels, follower graphs,
  contact fields, outreach fields, or person-identity claims.

Metric satellites:

- `creator_metric_observation` records individual source-visible metric facts.
- `creator_metric_rollup` records aggregate/current influence measures computed
  from observations.
- Rollups carry a calculation recipe/version, source window, freshness timestamp,
  and limitation state.
- Absence, hidden counts, blocked access, not-applicable metrics, and
  out-of-window facts must not be stored as observed zeroes.

Audience satellites:

- Ideal-audience Tier-1 fields may join into the current profile as content-fit
  enrichment.
- Tier-2-A aggregate audience demographic fields remain gated on a schema home
  and sourced base-rate/data prerequisites.
- Actual audience is not estimated by this view.

Current profile view:

- `creator_profile_current` is a derived view, materialized view, JSON export,
  dashboard query, or equivalent current snapshot.
- It may target either a `platform_account` subject or a linked
  `creator_record` subject.
- It may denormalize for operator convenience.
- It must preserve pointers back to the source sibling rows, versions, and
  freshness fields.
- It is not the source of truth for identity, metrics, or audience inference.

## Subject And Soft-Link Boundary

`creator_profile_current` supports two subject kinds:

- `platform_account`: one public account on one supported platform. This is the
  pre-linkage subject and may carry account-level metric rollups, ideal-audience
  snapshots, limitations, and source drill-back.
- `creator_record`: a linked public account cluster from the public-handle
  linkage ledger. This subject exists only when account-link evidence spans at
  least two platforms.

Soft links live in the public-handle linkage ledger as
`candidate_public_account_link` rows with `candidate_needs_review`. A candidate
link is a reversible pre-review bridge so the transition from similar unlinked
accounts to a linked cluster can be seamless after human review. It is not a
final creator identity, not a real-world identity claim, and not enough by
itself for cross-platform aggregate rollups.

## Aggregate Influence Rules

Average views and engagement rate belong in `creator_metric_rollup`, not in the
identity ledger.

Minimum rollup rules:

- Always state the window: 7d, 30d, 90d, or custom.
- Always state the platform scope: one platform or cross-platform.
- Always state which observation rows fed the rollup.
- Before public-handle linkage, aggregate influence attaches to
  `platform_account_id`.
- After public-handle linkage, cross-platform aggregate influence attaches to
  `creator_record_id` and lists the linked `platform_account_ids`.
- Cross-platform rollups must recompute from source metric observations or an
  equivalent deduplicated observation set; they must not sum stored
  account-level rollups as if those were independent raw observations.
- Always carry `computed_at` and `freshness_state`.
- Never treat hidden, blocked, absent, or not-applicable metrics as observed
  zeroes.
- Never mix reels/videos/posts without a recipe version that explains the
  content-kind inclusion rule.
- Never present an aggregate as current if its source window or computation is
  stale.

## Dashboard Boundary

`creator_profile_current` is the dashboard-ready surface.

Allowed dashboard use:

- show one observed platform account or one linked creator/account cluster;
- show latest average/aggregate influence metrics;
- show the source window and freshness for each aggregate;
- show the ideal-audience/content-fit profile when available;
- show limitations and missing-data states;
- drill back to source observations and evidence.

Forbidden dashboard use:

- contact/outreach authorization;
- lead-list export;
- public person-level directory;
- legal-name or real-world identity proof;
- follower graph or individual audience-member retention;
- actual audience demographics unless a later accepted schema home and data
  gate authorize the aggregate slice;
- unstamped, sourceless, or LLM-only influence claims.

## Creator Signal Boundary

The promoted Creator Signal surface lives at:

`orca/product/spines/creator_signal/creator_intelligence_profile_surface_v0.md`

This Capture spec still owns `creator_profile_current`, sibling record shapes,
join/denormalization mechanics, and capture-side dashboard allowed/forbidden use.
Creator Signal owns the product-facing interpretation and presentation of that
view: which facts matter to an Orca operator or buyer, how they are grouped, what
claims the surface may make, and which limitations must remain visible.

The Creator Signal surface must reconcile with this `Dashboard Boundary` and
inherit rather than relax its forbidden-use set.

## SQLite And Data Lake Boundary

SQLite can be a good later physical home, but it is not the next product
decision by itself.

The next correct sequence is:

1. Lock the table/view contract in product docs.
2. Test source-backed real identity rows and metric observation/rollup examples.
3. Promote to SQLite or another storage engine only after the sibling record
   shapes survive real rows and failure cases.

When physicalized, SQLite tables can map directly from the sibling shapes:

- `creator_records`
- `platform_accounts`
- `account_link_evidence`
- `creator_metric_observations`
- `creator_metric_rollups`
- `creator_ideal_audience_profile_snapshots`
- `creator_profile_current`

Data Lake owns storage/derived-result mechanics when adopted. This product
contract owns the view boundary and source-family semantics. A data-lake job may
compute the rollups later, but this document does not create that job.

## Non-Goals

This spec does not:

- create a database;
- choose SQLite;
- create a dashboard;
- add real creator rows;
- authorize live capture;
- authorize new source access;
- define the full data-lake physical schema;
- define a scoring model for wind-calling strength;
- create a public creator directory;
- authorize outreach, contact enrichment, or lead-list use;
- claim buyer proof, validation, readiness, or commercial usefulness.
