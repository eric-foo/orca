# Creator Registry

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: source_capture_family_registry_index
scope: >
  Folder front door for Orca creator-ledger artifacts: the known public account
  registry, public-handle linkage ledger, creator-profile current view, and the
  lake-native mapping that keeps Capture, Discovery, and Creator Signal aligned
  without turning creator intelligence into one giant document.
use_when:
  - Finding the current list of known creator/platform accounts.
  - Checking whether Discovery or Capture should treat an observed account as already known.
  - Explaining the split between creator registry, public-handle linkage, metric rollups, and the profile-current dashboard view.

stale_if:
  - Creator registry ownership moves out of Capture/social-media source family.
  - Discovery or Capture adopts a different known-account preflight index.
  - Creator Signal adopts a successor profile surface without reconciling this folder.
```

## Purpose

This folder is the creator-ledger home for social-media creator accounts.

It is intentionally a folder, not one huge document. The parts update at
different speeds and carry different authority:

- `creator_registry_index_v0.json` is the current check-before-work list for
  known public platform accounts and linked creator records.
- `creator_public_handle_linkage_ledger_v0.json` is the identity/linkage ledger:
  public platform accounts, handle evidence, soft links, promoted links, and
  rejected links.
- `creator_profile_current_view_v0.json` is the current one-stop profile export:
  identity plus joined rollups and source drill-back for operator/dashboard use.
- Metric observations, rollups, capture receipts, and future audience snapshots
  remain in their owning Capture/Silver producer records. They are not copied
  into the registry index as raw truth.

## Placement

The folder stays under:

`orca/product/spines/capture/core/source_families/social_media/creator_registry/`

That is the low-level social-media source-family contract home. The higher-level
consumer-facing surface is still the Creator Signal spine:

`orca/product/spines/creator_signal/creator_intelligence_profile_surface_v0.md`

In plain terms: Capture owns the registry and evidence boundaries; Creator Signal
owns how the buyer/operator sees the resulting profile.

## Dedupe Rule

Discovery should still observe known creators again. A repeat observation is
useful signal. The registry index only prevents duplicate rows and duplicate work:

```text
Discovery observes a handle or URL
-> normalize platform/account/handle
-> check creator_registry_index_v0.json
-> exact known account: attach discovery evidence to the existing account
-> possible same creator: create or refresh a candidate link review item
-> unknown account: create a new candidate stub through the owning source lane
```

## Non-Claims

- not a raw capture store
- not metric authority
- not audience authority
- not public person identity proof
- not a social follower graph
- not SQLite or dashboard implementation
- not buyer proof

## Direction Change Propagation

```yaml
direction_change_propagation:
  doctrine_changed: >
    Creator-ledger artifacts are now grouped under the Capture-owned social-media
    creator_registry folder: creator_registry_index_v0.json is the known-account
    preflight/dedupe list for Discovery and Capture, while public-handle linkage
    and profile-current remain separate sibling artifacts instead of one giant
    ledger document.

  intentionally_not_updated:
    - path: docs/prompts/, docs/review-inputs/, and docs/review-outputs/ historical prompt/review body prose
      reason: Historical commission/review artifacts keep point-in-time source paths in their body narrative by design; their open_next retrieval headers were repointed to the new creator_registry/ paths so the strict retrieval link gate stays green, and active product, map, code, and test surfaces were updated.

    - not live capture execution
