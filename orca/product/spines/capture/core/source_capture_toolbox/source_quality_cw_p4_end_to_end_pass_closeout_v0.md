## Status

Status: `SOURCE_QUALITY_CW_P4_END_TO_END_PASS_CLOSEOUT_V0`.

This artifact closes a bounded one-source Mini God-Tier source-quality pass for
`CW-P4`. The pass exercised the intended loop:

```text
source-unit queue posture -> packet inspection -> helper skeleton ->
operator-finalized report block -> queue row reported
```

The pass did not discover, select, rank, score, admit, or judge sources. The
packet remains scratch lifecycle evidence under `_test_runs/`, not an admitted
fixture or durable raw-source repository.

## Helper Skeleton Output

The report-skeleton helper was run against the packet and wrote:

```text
orca-harness/_test_runs/source_quality_cw_p4_end_to_end_20260603/cw_p4_skeleton.yaml
```

Fresh read showed the helper output:

```yaml
suggested_result_token: mini_god_tier_with_visible_limitations
result_token_finalization: operator_review_required
best_in_bound_body:
  posture: preserved
  preserved_body_path: raw/02_archive_snapshot_body.bin
  sha256: 1e4cfc078afc878e9430ef1e7be20c7587afdb857ab7eaefae7acca7c5d17c7c
  byte_count: 298903
  source_or_snapshot_time: "20220511053411"
source_language_anchors:
  - "operator_fill_required: helper did not infer source-language anchors from raw body"
coverage_or_drift_note: "operator_fill_required: helper did not infer coverage or drift relationship"
visible_limitations:
  - "Archive.org snapshot_count, when present, reflects collapse=digest availability rows, not archive completeness proof."
```

This is the expected helper behavior. The helper did not finalize
`mini_god_tier_met`; it only shaped the packet evidence and left source-language
anchors and coverage/drift to operator completion.

## Six-Criteria Check

| Mini God-Tier criterion | CW-P4 result |
| --- | --- |
| Best in-bound body possession | Met. A cutoff-compatible Archive.org snapshot body is preserved at `raw/02_archive_snapshot_body.bin`. |
| Identity and provenance | Met. Original locator, final snapshot locator, HTTP status, content type, capture time, snapshot timestamp, byte count, and SHA256 are visible. |
| Source-language anchors | Met. The preserved body contains bounded title, date/place, production, facility, and cash anchors. |
| Coverage or drift note | Met. The pass improves prior posture by preserving a historical archive body rather than relying on current/live body capture or archive metadata alone. |
| Visible limitations | Met. Archive completeness and scratch lifecycle limitations are explicit. |
| Lifecycle state | Met. Lifecycle is `scratch`; no separate fixture admission is implied. |

## Pass Finding

The CW-P4 pass confirms the Mini God-Tier loop works end to end for a preserved
historical source body:

1. the queue row represented the bounded source unit without discovering or
   ranking sources;
2. packet inspection confirmed a cutoff-compatible archive body, not just
   metadata;
3. the skeleton helper preserved conservative behavior and did not finalize a
   clean token;
4. operator completion supplied bounded anchors and coverage/drift from the
   preserved body;
5. row status reached `reported` only after the final report block existed.

No helper code change or result-token vocabulary change is required from this
pass.

## Friction

- The packet is under `_test_runs/`, so future strict source-quality claims
  depend on that scratch packet still being available unless a separate
  fixture-admission or retention decision preserves it durably.
- The helper correctly avoids source-body inference, but that means the
  operator still has to inspect raw body text for anchors before finalizing
  `mini_god_tier_met`.
- Archive.org `snapshot_count` remains availability posture, not completeness
  proof.

## Next Learning

The next highest-value source-quality pass should test a harder boundary:

- a source unit where the best available body is current-only; or
- a source unit where media, browser rendering, or login-visible content affects
  source-quality posture.

Do not treat this CW-P4 success as proof that all source families are handled.

## Non-Claims

This closeout is not validation, readiness, source completeness proof, fixture
admission, rights clearance, retention policy, sensitivity review, source
discovery, source selection, source-quality scoring, Judgment scoring, ECR
design, Cleaning implementation, buyer proof, commercial-readiness evidence,
source-access boundary amendment, or authorization for new adapters, APIs,
crawlers, browser fallback, commercial fetch, or production runtime.
