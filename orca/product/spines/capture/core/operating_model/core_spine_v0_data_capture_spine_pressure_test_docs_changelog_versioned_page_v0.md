- Status: PRESSURE_TEST_FIXTURE_V0
- Artifact type: Data Capture Spine setup pressure test
- Captured: 2026-05-25
- External docs surfaces refreshed: 2026-05-25
- Candidate: Kubernetes Deprecated API Migration Guide, bounded to the v1.32 removal section across live current docs, official v1.32 static docs, v1.32 release blog, release/version page, and current GitHub raw source.
- Data Capture status claimed: setup / pressure-test mode only
- Implementation authorized: no
- Runtime/source-system design authorized: no
- ECR/Cleaning design authorized: no
- Source-of-truth promotion claimed: no

Non-claims: this artifact does not claim Data Capture closure, acceptance,
formal validation, source-of-truth promotion, ECR/Cleaning readiness,
runtime/tooling readiness, implementation readiness, Kubernetes source
correctness, Kubernetes historical visibility at any prior cutoff, or archive
capture completion.

## 1. Retrieval Header And Non-Claims

Purpose: pressure-test whether the draft Data Capture obligation contract can
preserve docs, changelog, API-doc, policy, pricing, or versioned public-page
state without flattening version, edit, release, archive, and cutoff posture
into a generic page summary.

Use when: deciding whether the docs/changelog/versioned-page fixture exposed a
material contract patch before the archive/history fixture.

Do not use for: Kubernetes upgrade advice, Kubernetes API migration advice,
historical proof that a page was visible at a prior cutoff, credibility,
Decision Strength, Action Ceiling, ECR field design, Cleaning transformation
design, runtime scraping, source maps, dashboards, APIs, storage, automation,
or readiness claims.

Authority boundary: current user instruction, `AGENTS.md`, and the Orca overlay
control this artifact. Local Data Capture docs are setup sources, not
acceptance, validation, or source-of-truth promotion evidence. External
Kubernetes pages are mutable public sources and only support the fixture slice
recorded here.

Recheck recipe: recompute the local hashes above, re-open the external URLs in
the source-read ledger, and treat any changed external page wording, version
menu, last-modified line, static snapshot notice, release-page state, or GitHub
source posture as a mutable-source change rather than silently reusing this
fixture.

## 2. Start Preflight And Source-Read Ledger

```text
orca_start_preflight:
  agents_read: yes
  overlay_read: yes
  source_pack: custom S3 target deepening for Data Capture setup / pressure-test packet plus retrieval-header guidance and external docs/versioned pages

  dirty_state_checked: yes
  blocked_if_missing: AGENTS.md; overlay README; source-loading; repo map; fixture plan; obligation contract; context note; architecture blueprint; review-surface fixture
```

Dirty state note: `git status --short` showed many pre-existing modified and
untracked files. Relevant source statuses are recorded in the ledger. This
artifact treats modified or untracked setup docs as repo-visible task sources,
not as proof of acceptance, validation, readiness, or source-of-truth
promotion.

## 3. Candidate Selected And Why It Admits As A Docs / Changelog / Versioned-Page Fixture

Selected candidate: Kubernetes Deprecated API Migration Guide, bounded to the
v1.32 removed-API section and its surrounding source-family posture.

Fixture URLs:

- Current docs page: `https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/`
- Official v1.32 static docs snapshot: `https://v1-32.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/`
- v1.32 release blog: `https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/11/kubernetes-v1-32-release/`
- Kubernetes releases page: `https://kubernetes.io/releases/`
- Current GitHub raw source: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide.md`

Why it admits:

- It is a public versioned docs/API-docs page, not a generic static article.
- It exposes event timing: the v1.32 release blog is dated December 11, 2024
  and names the v1.32 API removal.
- It exposes live current versus prior-version posture: current docs describe
  v1.32 removal as already happened, while the official v1.32 static snapshot
  describes the same removal as future relative to that snapshot.
- It exposes visible last-modified/update metadata on both the current page and
  the v1.32 snapshot.
- It exposes version and support state through the release page and docs
  version menu: current maintained release branches are separate from v1.32,
  which appears under end-of-life releases.
- It exposes archive/prior-version posture through the official v1.32 docs
  snapshot, while also making clear that this is not the same as independent
  historical proof of a page's visibility at a chosen cutoff.
- It creates cutoff leakage risk: a live current page captured in 2026 can
  smuggle post-December-2024 state into a pre-release or at-release decision
  window if Capture flattens the page into "Kubernetes docs say..."

This is a target-risk fixture. It is not a representative study of Kubernetes
documentation quality, release communication quality, or upgrade risk.

## 4. Docs / Changelog Capture Slice: What Was Preserved And Why

The slice preserved only the source context needed to make the version/timing
risk inspectable:

- source family: public versioned technical documentation and release blog;
- source identity: Kubernetes documentation, Kubernetes release blog,
  Kubernetes releases page, and public GitHub source file;
- bounded topic: the v1.32 removed API section for
  `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3` FlowSchema and
  PriorityLevelConfiguration;
- event wording: the release blog records the v1.32 release on December 11,
  2024 and states the API version was removed in v1.32;
- current-page wording: the live deprecation guide says the v1.32 release
  stopped serving the deprecated API version;
- v1.32 snapshot wording: the official v1.32 docs snapshot says the v1.32
  release will stop serving the deprecated API version;
- current-page last-modified metadata: May 16, 2025 at 2:49 PM PST, tied to an
  update for the v1.32 deprecation guide;
- v1.32 snapshot last-modified metadata: March 17, 2024 at 12:37 AM PST, tied
  to an HPA guidance update, even though the snapshot also contains the v1.32
  section;
- release-page posture: as captured on 2026-05-25, v1.32 is listed as
  end-of-life with final patch release 1.32.13 and EOL date 2026-02-28, while
  newer release branches are maintained;
- archive/prior-version posture: the official v1.32 docs page marks itself as
  a static snapshot and points to the latest version.

Preservation rationale:

- exact tense carries the fixture signal, so "will stop" and "stopped" must
  not be normalized away;
- page-level last-modified metadata must stay separate from release-event
  timing, capture timing, and item-level/version-section timing;
- the official static snapshot must be preserved as a source-visible
  prior-version surface, not silently treated as proof of historical visibility
  at an arbitrary pre-release cutoff;
- the release blog is needed because docs pages alone do not supply the
  release event timing cleanly;
- the releases page is needed because live current docs include present-day
  support/version posture that can leak into a prior decision window;
- the GitHub raw source is useful source-family context for visible source
  history posture, but current raw source is not proof of older public page
  state.

## 5. Timing And Version Posture

Publication or event timing:

- The v1.32 release blog is dated December 11, 2024.
- The release blog states that v1.32 included one API removal:
  `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3` for FlowSchema and
  PriorityLevelConfiguration.

Last-edit, update, and version posture:

- The live current deprecation guide records a last-modified line dated May 16,
  2025 at 2:49 PM PST, with an update label for the v1.32 deprecation guide.
- The official v1.32 static snapshot records a last-modified line dated March
  17, 2024 at 12:37 AM PST, with an HPA guidance update label.
- The v1.32 snapshot also contains a v1.32 section. That creates a visible
  metadata-scope risk: the page-level last-modified line cannot be treated as
  proof that every section, especially the v1.32 section, was publicly visible
  at that March 2024 timestamp.
- The current release page captured on 2026-05-25 lists maintained release
  branches separately from end-of-life releases and places Kubernetes 1.32 in
  the end-of-life table.

Capture timing:

- This fixture was captured on 2026-05-25 in the current Codex session.
- The capture is after the v1.32 release date and after the current docs
  page's May 16, 2025 update line.

Cutoff posture:

- For a post-release decision with a cutoff after May 16, 2025, the live
  current page can be treated as post-update current-docs material, still with
  external mutability limits.
- For a decision cutoff at or before December 11, 2024, the live current page
  is post-window material and must be marked as cutoff-leakage risk.
- For a pre-release decision, the v1.32 static snapshot is useful but not
  sufficient by itself. It uses future-tense wording, but its static-snapshot
  capture point and page-level metadata do not prove exact pre-release
  visibility.
- The correct Capture posture is mixed/source-limited unless an exact prior
  archive, commit history, release branch source, or other time-bound evidence
  is used.

Behavior posture:

- The live current docs describe removed behavior as already removed.
- The v1.32 static snapshot describes the same v1.32 removal as future
  behavior.
- The release blog describes the removal as part of the release event.
- The releases page describes the broader current support posture after v1.32
  has become end-of-life.

## 6. Archive / Cache / Prior-Version Posture

Visible prior-version posture:

- The official v1.32 documentation site is available at
  `https://v1-32.docs.kubernetes.io/`.
- The v1.32 deprecation-guide page states that Kubernetes v1.32 documentation
  is no longer actively maintained and that the viewed version is a static
  snapshot.
- The v1.32 page links to the latest version.

Visible source-history posture:

- The current live docs page exposes GitHub contribution links and a
  last-modified commit link.
- The current raw source file is publicly visible on GitHub's raw content
  endpoint.
- These surfaces show that repository-backed source history is likely
  inspectable, but this fixture did not reconstruct full commit history.

Unavailable or not attempted:

- Independent archive.org, browser cache, CDN cache, search-engine cache, or
  third-party cache checks were not attempted in this fixture.
- No exact historical page snapshot was obtained for a pre-December-11-2024
  cutoff.
- No release-branch raw source file was fetched for the v1.32 docs snapshot.
- No claim is made that the current live page, the current GitHub raw source,
  or the v1.32 static snapshot proves what a public viewer could see on any
  arbitrary prior date.

Archive posture for this fixture:

```text
archive_history_posture:
  official_prior_version_snapshot: available
  independent_archive: not_attempted
  cache: not_attempted
  exact_pre_window_visibility: unavailable_by_source in this fixture
  source_history_reconstruction: not_attempted
```

This is enough for the docs/changelog/versioned-page fixture. It is not enough
to satisfy the later archive/history fixture with recapture.

## 7. Obligations Tested

Tested obligations:

- Commissioning Gate.
- Boundary Compliance.
- Capture-Event Provenance.
- Capture Mode Disclosure.
- Mode-Change Rule.
- Raw Observable Preservation.
- Source Identity And Actor Context.
- Decomposed Timing.
- Cutoff Posture.
- Archive / Historical Posture.
- Source Visibility And Access Limits.
- Related Context Preservation, especially the docs, changelog, API-docs,
  policy, pricing, and versioned-page branch.
- Capture Failure And Blocker Visibility.
- Re-Capture Semantics.
- Categorical Handoff Sufficiency.
- Forbidden Outputs From Capture.

Not materially tested:

- Bundled-Offer Structure Observables, because the candidate did not present a
  multi-term offer, public-sector package, regulatory bargain, settlement, or
  counterparty bundle.
- Review-surface obligations, because those were covered in the prior ClickUp
  fixture.
- Multimodal capture sufficiency, because text and page metadata carried the
  load-bearing signal. A rendered capture could still be required in a future
  run if labels, selector state, UI placement, or hidden/truncated version
  controls become load-bearing.

## 8. Obligations That Held

Commissioning Gate held for setup pressure testing. The current user supplied a
specific product-method decision: pressure-test whether the docs/changelog and
versioned-page obligations require a patch before the archive/history fixture.
This is enough to start a pressure-test capture. It is not a buyer Decision
Frame and does not make the captured Kubernetes docs ECR-ready.

Boundary Compliance held. The inspected material was public documentation,
blog, release, and raw-source content accessed without private credentials,
deception, ordinary-person dossiers, or intrusive collection.

Capture-Event Provenance held at product-method level. The artifact records
capture date, operator category, local source hashes, external URLs, external
mutability limits, and the obligation-contract source used for the fixture.

Capture Mode Disclosure held. The mode was agent-assisted public web
inspection and local repo reading, with human-led obligation assessment in the
artifact. No scraper, API, archive service, runtime tool, dashboard, storage,
or source-system design was used.

Mode-Change Rule held. No material mode change occurred after candidate
selection. The fixture stayed inside agent-assisted inspection of public docs
surfaces.

Source Identity And Actor Context held. The contract was sufficient to
separate source carrier from source actor: Kubernetes documentation, release
blog, release page, and GitHub source are carriers; the source actor is the
Kubernetes project or documentation/release surface where visible. Capture did
not decide credibility or representativeness.

Decomposed Timing held. The contract already requires publication/event,
last-edit/version, capture, recapture, and cutoff timing to remain separate.
That separation is exactly what this candidate needed.

Cutoff Posture held. The contract forced the live current page to be treated as
post-window material for any pre-release or at-release decision window instead
of letting the current docs page become historical evidence by default.

Archive / Historical Posture held as a categorical obligation. The contract had
a place to record official prior-version snapshot availability and independent
archive/cache non-attempts without pretending that archive proof existed.

Source Visibility And Access Limits held. The contract handled public
visibility, official static-snapshot posture, source-history affordances,
current release-page mutation, and metadata-scope limits without turning those
constraints into credibility or exclusion decisions.

Related Context Preservation held. The docs/changelog branch in the contract
explicitly names version, edit, deprecation, future/current, cache, archive,
and backfill posture where visible. That was the right obligation surface for
this candidate.

Capture Failure And Blocker Visibility held. The contract had enough discharge
states to mark exact pre-window visibility, independent archive, commit-history
reconstruction, and item-level edit timing as unavailable, not attempted, or
source-limited rather than silently omitting them.

Forbidden Outputs From Capture held. The fixture did not assign credibility,
weight, exclusion, Decision Strength, Action Ceiling, Signal Use
Classification, source-quality score, Cleaning transformation, ECR schema, or
runtime-source effect.

Categorical Handoff Sufficiency held as a boundary. The contract can carry
docs/versioned-page state categorically downstream without defining ECR fields,
keys, IDs, tables, schemas, storage, or Cleaning transformations.

## 9. Obligations Partial, Blocked, Unavailable, Not Attempted, Or Source-Limited

Raw Observable Preservation: partial in this pressure-test artifact. The
artifact preserved the load-bearing wording and source locators, but it did not
embed a full page snapshot or full raw source file. A real commissioned capture
would need full relevant page text, snapshot, or a visible limitation.

Page-level versus section-level edit timing: source-limited. The page-level
last-modified lines are visible, but they cannot be treated as item-level
timing for every section. The v1.32 static snapshot's March 2024
last-modified line is especially unsafe as proof of the v1.32 section's public
visibility.

Backfill or silent-change proof: unavailable_by_source in this fixture. The
current and v1.32 pages expose a meaningful tense and metadata mismatch, but
the fixture does not prove whether the source was silently changed, backfilled,
or materially updated without reconstructing repository history or archives.

Exact prior-window visibility: blocked/source-limited. The official v1.32
snapshot is a prior-version surface, but it is not proof that a public viewer
could see the same content on a specific pre-release date. Exact visibility
would require a time-bound archive, commit state, release branch source, or
other historical evidence.

Independent archive/cache posture: not_attempted. This fixture did not query
Wayback, search-engine caches, CDN caches, or browser caches. That omission is
intentional because the next fixture owns archive/history and recapture.

Re-Capture Semantics: not triggered. The external pages are mutable enough that
future changes should trigger recapture if a later task depends on the same
candidate, but no source-state change was observed during this fixture.

Multimodal capture: not_attempted/not_applicable for this slice. Text and
metadata carried the load-bearing signal. Rendered capture would become
required if version selector state, labels, page banners, truncation, or
dynamic UI state became the evidence.

Bundled-Offer Structure Observables: not_applicable.

## 10. Cutoff Leakage And Live-Page Mutation Analysis

The live current deprecation guide is useful but dangerous for cutoff-sensitive
work. Captured on 2026-05-25, it reflects post-release and post-update state.
For any decision window before or around the v1.32 release on December 11,
2024, the live page can leak later knowledge into a prior analysis.

The leak is not subtle. The live current page says the v1.32 release stopped
serving the deprecated API version. The official v1.32 snapshot says the
release will stop serving that API version. Flattening those into "the docs
say v1.32 removes the API" loses the source-visible posture that distinguishes
future warning, release-event notice, current behavior, and historical support
state.

The release page adds another leakage channel. On 2026-05-25 it shows current
maintained release branches and places v1.32 under end-of-life releases. That
is valid current context, but it is not valid pre-release context. Capture must
preserve the release-page capture date and current-version posture instead of
letting it contaminate a 2024 decision window.

The v1.32 static snapshot reduces but does not eliminate leakage risk. It
preserves a versioned docs surface and future-tense wording, but it does not
prove exact visibility at a chosen prior date. Its page-level last-modified
line predates the v1.32 release by months, while the page contains a v1.32
section. The correct Data Capture move is to preserve that mismatch as a
source-visible limitation, not to force a conclusion that the page was or was
not backfilled.

The contract handled this risk because it requires decomposed timing, cutoff
posture, archive/history posture, visible source limits, and docs/versioned
context. The artifact had to use those obligations explicitly. A generic page
summary would have failed the fixture.

## 11. Material Patch Decision

Material patch decision: no core obligation-contract patch is required before
the archive/history fixture.

Reason: the current contract already requires the decisive behaviors this
candidate needed:

- publication/event timing separated from last-edit/version timing and capture
  timing;
- cutoff posture as a first-class capture fact;
- archive/history posture recorded even when archive is only available,
  not attempted, failed, or source-limited;
- source visibility and access limits preserved without credibility effects;
- docs, changelog, API-docs, policy, pricing, and versioned-page posture
  preserved for version, edit, deprecation, future/current, cache, archive,
  and backfill signals;
- source claim kept separate from Orca interpretation;
- no ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, or runtime output from Capture.

A core patch now would overfit the contract to one Kubernetes documentation
convention. The right carry-forward is satellite guidance for docs and
versioned public pages, plus a deliberate archive/history fixture that tests
independent archive, cache, deleted/edited visibility, and recapture.

This is not a claim that the contract is accepted, validated, hardened, or
ready.

## 12. Source-Family Satellite Guidance

Docs/changelog/versioned-page satellites should preserve:

- source surface family: live docs, release notes, changelog, policy page,
  pricing page, API reference, official prior-version docs, repository source,
  independent archive, cache, or third-party mirror;
- source-visible version posture: current, future, beta, deprecated, removed,
  static snapshot, end-of-life, unsupported, maintained, or unknown;
- exact source wording where tense carries meaning, especially future/current
  shifts such as "will stop" versus "stopped";
- event timing separately from page publication, page last-modified,
  section-level update, capture timing, and recapture timing;
- metadata scope: whether a last-modified line appears page-level,
  section-level, release-level, repository-level, generated-site-level, or
  ambiguous;
- visible source-history affordances, such as edit links, commit links, raw
  source, release branches, version selectors, and static snapshot banners;
- archive/cache/prior-version status as separate posture categories, including
  official versioned snapshots versus independent historical archives;
- cutoff leakage warnings when live current docs include post-window state;
- unresolved history gaps without forcing a backfill, silent-edit, or
  historical-visibility conclusion.

Satellite rules should not require every docs capture to reconstruct full Git
history or archive history. They should require the capture to expose whether
that history was available, used, failed, not attempted, or unnecessary for the
commissioned decision.

Satellite rules must not promote themselves into core unless they survive
comparison across at least two non-overlapping source families or the owner
accepts a specific invariant.

## 13. Downstream ECR / Cleaning Notes, Categorical Only

ECR should receive docs/versioned-page context categorically: source carrier,
source actor or publisher category, page title, URL family, release/event
timing, page update posture, version posture, exact load-bearing wording,
archive/prior-version/cache posture, capture timing, cutoff posture, visible
source limits, and explicit unavailable/not-attempted history checks.

Cleaning should not normalize tense, version state, or support state into one
current-behavior statement. It should preserve the relationship among release
event, current docs, prior-version docs, source history, and archive/cache
posture before any downstream reduction.

Cleaning should keep release blogs, current docs, static snapshots, release
pages, and raw repository source separate as source surfaces. It should not
merge them into a single "Kubernetes says" summary unless the source-state
differences remain inspectable.

These are categorical carry-forward notes only. They do not define ECR fields,
keys, IDs, tables, schemas, storage, file formats, Cleaning transformations,
dedupe rules, clustering, dashboards, APIs, scrapers, source maps, or runtime
tooling.

## 14. Not-Proven Boundaries And Next Routing Object

This fixture does not prove:

- Data Capture Spine is accepted, validated, complete, closed, hardened,
  source-of-truth promoted, implementation-ready, runtime-ready, ECR-ready, or
  Cleaning-ready.
- The Kubernetes live docs page proves historical visibility at any prior
  decision cutoff.
- The v1.32 static snapshot proves exact pre-release visibility.
- Kubernetes docs were or were not silently changed, backfilled, or materially
  updated beyond the visible source posture recorded here.
- Independent archive, cache, release-branch source, or full commit-history
  reconstruction was performed.
- Any Kubernetes API migration, support, upgrade, or product judgment.
- Any source should be included, excluded, weighted, discounted, deduplicated,
  clustered, or treated as decision-useful.
- Any Decision Strength, Action Ceiling, Signal Use Classification, buyer
  proof, product readiness, commercial readiness, or Core Spine validation
  result.
- Future ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, source maps, APIs, scrapers, storage,
  dashboards, automation, tests, deployment, or runtime systems are authorized.

Next routing object: archive/history pressure-test fixture with recapture
sub-case.

Reason: no material core obligation defect appeared in the
docs/changelog/versioned-page fixture. The fixture sequence should continue,
carrying only the satellite guidance above. The archive/history fixture should
deliberately test deleted, edited, cached, archive-only, prior-window,
failed-access, visibility-shift, and recapture relationship risks. This does
not claim Data Capture Spine closure, acceptance, validation, source-of-truth
promotion, ECR/Cleaning readiness, runtime/tooling readiness, or implementation
readiness.
