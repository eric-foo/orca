# Orca Discovery — Consumer-Demand Target-Selection Brief v0 (PROPOSED)

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Product artifact (live discovery instrument — adopted 2026-06-12)
scope: >
  Target-selection instrument for the consumer-demand/beauty first proof:
  blank target slots, qualification objectives, and stop rules derived from
  the ratified thesis + wedge (2026-06-12). Replaces the pricing-gated
  orca_discovery_batch_0_target_selection_brief_v0.md, which pricing-first
  propagation AR-01 already flagged as a misrouting live instrument. Slots
  are intentionally blank: no candidate scan is authorized yet, and the
  standing no-buyer-contact gate is closed (owner ask 4, 2026-06-12).

## Status

`ADOPTED_LIVE_INSTRUMENT` — adopted 2026-06-12 by the ratification cascade
(owner ratified thesis asks 1-2; runbook step 6). Supersedes the batch-0
target-selection brief as the live instrument. Prepared 2026-06-11 by the
ICP / product-direction lane. The companion instrument —
`docs/prompts/product-planning/orca_product_proof_lead_customer_discovery_prompt_v0.md`
— is OUTSIDE the product lane's write scope (prompt artifact). Corrected
2026-06-12 (gap DB-5): ORCA-HYGIENE-018 was resolved by RETIRING that prompt
outright (RETIRED / OFF-TARGET banner, 2026-06-12), not by realigning it. No
live discovery operating prompt exists; when the owner opens outreach, a
consumer-demand successor must be commissioned through prompt orchestration
before any discovery runs.

Dated note (2026-06-12, owner ask-1 amendment): the capture risk posture is
measured ToS risk accepted / absurd-level rejected (the owner's example:
Bright-Data-style industrial scraping); per-venue route bindings stay
capture-lane-owned. The stop rules below are stated under that posture.

## Commercial Target Selection Update (2026-06-16)

Owner direction confirms that blank discovery slots, when a candidate-scan lane
is separately authorized, should target US-market tractioned indie/DTC beauty
or personal-care operators with a named decision owner and a live 30-90 day
demand-allocation decision.

Prioritize candidate contexts with retail/channel expansion,
launch/reposition, or inventory/purchase-depth commitment. Tier/price,
taste-shift pivot, and defend/hold decisions remain eligible only when they
pass the same qualification gates.

Retailer/category teams are deferred for this first 2-3 month door because
their proprietary sell-through, basket, loyalty, and vendor data often makes
the "internal data not conclusive" gate harder to satisfy. Agencies and
incubators may later route to accountable brand decision owners, but their
interest is not a slot-fill substitute. Consumer fund screen and then
PE/family-office diligence remain fallback/destination classes only if the
operator-first proof path fails or the owner re-orders the ladder.

Do not use target selection to request or plan proprietary-data intake.
Customer-provided internal data may later improve judgment accuracy under a
separately authorized proof or data-spine lane, but this discovery instrument
selects public-first cases where the manual memo and evidence appendix can be
credible without that intake.

## Output Boundary (carried unchanged from batch 0)

Docs-first target-selection instrument only. It does not authorize buyer
outreach (standing gate: no buyer contact before full-spine MVP —
`docs/decisions/advisory_proof_slice_definition_v0.md` — closed unless the
owner names an opening condition under thesis ask 4), public web research,
candidate scanning, memo or deck production, product-bet or feature planning,
implementation, source systems, dashboards, source maps, data-spine design,
CRM workflows, commits, pushes, or PRs. Filling the blank slots below requires
a separately authorized candidate-scan lane.

## Target Slots (blank by design)

| Slot | Candidate context (brand + live decision) | Decision family | Independent demand-venue origins visible (laundered / shared-origination copies = one; org-motion / retail excluded — see corroboration column) | Costly-behavior evidence visible | Org-motion route available (capture-lane-bound routes) | Named decision owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | `UNFILLED - requires authorized candidate scan` | — | — | — | — | — | empty |
| T2 | `UNFILLED - requires authorized candidate scan` | — | — | — | — | — | empty |
| T3 | `UNFILLED - requires authorized candidate scan` | — | — | — | — | — | empty |
| T4 | `UNFILLED - requires authorized candidate scan` | — | — | — | — | — | empty |
| T5 | `UNFILLED - requires authorized candidate scan` | — | — | — | — | — | empty |
| T6 | `UNFILLED - requires authorized candidate scan` | — | — | — | — | — | empty |

Slot-tier guidance: **1 independent demand-venue origin → hold / low-commitment
ceiling; ≥2 converging independent origins → material-action eligible**
(org-motion / retail presence = corroboration, not counted toward origins).

Slot-fill rule: a slot may be filled only from a dated, provenance-noted
candidate scan produced by an authorized lane; no slot is filled from memory,
from another lane's unverified summary, or from this lane. Slots default
US-market per the thesis geography doctrine (2026-06-12); non-US candidates
route to the owner or defer (mirroring the candidate-pool handoff
obligations). Candidate companies are not buyers, leads, prospects, or
clients; trust posture is `unknown` until qualification.

Record homes (bound 2026-06-12, gap DB-4, owner word): candidate-scan
outputs are research artifacts and live in `docs/research/` (filename prefix
`orca_discovery_candidate_scan_`); a slot fills only from such a dated scan
doc. The backtest candidate pool
(`orca/product/case_families/product_learning/fragrance/consumer_demand_candidate_pool_handoff_v0.md`) is
outcome-bearing backtest material and is NEVER a slot source. Near-miss,
hold, and disqualification records from the stop rules go to the proof-batch
notes home (`docs/product/product_lead/orca_proof_batch_<n>_notes_v0.md`,
per the charter).

## Qualification Objectives (first contact, when outreach is ever opened)

Derived from the wedge and the live buyer-proof packet; the packet's
Demand-Substrate Hard Gate and disqualifiers control on any conflict.

1. Confirm a live 30-90 day consumer-demand allocation decision at a
   US-market tractioned indie/DTC beauty or personal-care brand, prioritizing
   retail/channel expansion, launch/moratorium/reposition, and
   inventory/purchase-depth commitment; tier/price, taste-shift pivot, and
   defend/hold remain eligible only when they pass the same gates.
2. Confirm a named decision owner (founder, head of brand / insights /
   growth / strategy) and a concrete allocation consequence.
3. Confirm the Demand-Substrate Hard Gate is satisfiable for this decision:
   enough effectively-independent **demand-venue origins** visible for the
   intended **commitment** (laundered copies / shared-origination siblings
   collapse to one; **org-motion including retail presence is corroboration, not
   a demand family**), a gradeable costly-behavior instance present, integrity
   labels applicable, no route outside the capture lane's current bindings
   required (and no absurd-risk route at any time).
4. Classify public-signal trust state (`trust_open` / `trust_objection` /
   `trust_refusal`) per `.agents/workflow-overlay/product-proof.md`; only
   categorical `trust_refusal` disqualifies.
5. Test paid-first willingness before any custom artifact work.
6. Record pull versus praise per the packet; praise, curiosity, and generic
   deck interest are not pull.

## Stop Rules (carried unchanged)

- Stop at any disqualifier in the buyer-proof packet.
- Stop if qualification would require outreach while the no-buyer-contact
  gate is closed.
- Stop if signal coverage would require a route outside the capture lane's
  current bindings or an absurd-risk approach (owner posture 2026-06-12:
  measured ToS risk accepted; Bright-Data-style industrial scraping
  rejected). Route expansion is a capture-lane decision, not a
  discovery-time stretch.
- Do not stretch the wedge around a near-miss candidate; record the gap and
  hold or disqualify.

## Claim-Tier Classification

Design / product-learning-tier instrument; no proof, readiness, validation,
or judgment-quality claim; closeout state for any such claim:
`no_durable_evidence`.

## Non-Claims

Live instrument only — not candidate selection, not buyer validation, not
outreach authority, not a research authorization, not proof of anything.
Blank slots are a deliberate boundary, not an omission. Mints no
evidence-ladder vocabulary; redefines no overlay-owned semantics.
