# Core Spine v0 Data Lake Metric Family Field Contract — Source-Backed Brand/Line Share of Voice (v0)

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Product architecture decision contract
scope: >
  The field-level posture/reason/coverage contract for the owner-named metric
  family source_backed_brand_line_share_of_voice — the binding the consumption
  seam contract's field-level gate requires before any view of this family may
  be built. Binds readout identity, grouping, numerator/denominator and
  coverage fields, window basis, posture semantics, and the fields that may
  never exist. Field contract only: it authorizes no view build, no capture,
  and no engine.
use_when:
  - Building or reviewing any share-of-voice computation or view over lake evidence.
  - Checking whether a SoV readout's fields are honest (coverage, posture, denominator basis).
  - Deciding whether the family's view-build gate is satisfied.

stale_if:
  - The Silver Vault metric posture vocabulary or coupling rules change.
  - A Cleaning-owned brand/line canonicalization decision lands (fires the grouping upgrade trigger).
  - A later owner decision renames or retires the family or changes the seam contract's metrics policy.

## Status

`SOV_FIELD_CONTRACT_RECORDED_V0`. Authored under owner-directed disciplined
continuation (2026-07-02) of the consumption-seam lane, satisfying the seam
contract's field-level gate for `source_backed_brand_line_share_of_voice`
(family owner-named 2026-07-02, PR #580). Not validation, readiness, view-build
execution, capture authorization, or engine selection. The sibling family
`movement_threshold_crossings` remains gate-blocked (its field contract is a
separate decision).

## Decision In One Screen

```text
A share-of-voice readout is honest only if it says: over WHICH captured
evidence (platform, cohort, window, coverage counts), grouped by WHAT
(exact brand/line strings, fragmentation disclosed), out of WHAT denominator
(captured source-backed mentions only), with missing evidence as posture +
reason — never a zero, never a market-total implication, never cross-platform.
Every number must recompute from committed records cited by ref.
```

## Readout Identity Fields (required on every readout)

| Field | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| `metric_family` | Literal `source_backed_brand_line_share_of_voice`. |
| `family_schema_version` | This contract's field-schema version (`1` for v0); any field change bumps it. |
| `platform` | Exactly one platform (`instagram` / `youtube` / `tiktok` / …). Per-platform only — a readout spanning platforms is forbidden (medallion cross-platform identity limitation). |
| `cohort` | Declared, never inferred: `{cohort_id, definition, member_basis: "captured_set", member_count, member_refs \| cohort_manifest_ref}`. The refs/manifest identify the captured source objects included in the cohort and must reconcile to `coverage.source_objects_in_scope`; cohort membership claims about uncaptured creators are unrepresentable. |
| `coverage_window` | `{start, end, window_basis}` with `window_basis: capture_time \| source_publication_time`. `capture_time` is evaluated against `captured_at` or equivalent packet capture metadata (universally available — every packet records it). `source_publication_time` is evaluated only when a committed source-backed record carries source publication/event timing evidence (`observed_at`, `source_publication_or_event`, or a source-family equivalent); records lacking the selected basis are excluded from numerator AND denominator and counted under `coverage.window_basis_missing` — never silently dropped. If no source-backed record in scope has the selected basis in-window, the readout is `unavailable_with_reason` and emits no share rows. |
| `selection_policy_versions` | Must include: extractor rubric version(s) of the consumed mention records, `silver_lineage_gate: "source_backed_complete"` (the live status literal), `family_schema_version`, `brand_grouping` (see Grouping), and `cohort_selection` (the version or manifest identity behind `cohort.member_refs` / `cohort_manifest_ref`). |

## Grouping Fields

- `grouping_basis: "exact_string_v0"` — brand/line group keys are the exact
  strings from committed mention records. The lake never normalizes
  (storage-contract no-cleaning rule); no Cleaning-owned brand/line
  canonicalization exists today (verified 2026-07-02).
- `fragmentation_note` — required non-empty field stating that case/spelling
  variants of one real-world brand appear as separate rows until a
  Cleaning-owned canonicalization is adopted.
- Upgrade trigger: a Cleaning-owned canonicalization decision lands → readouts
  may group on it ONLY by citing its version in
  `selection_policy_versions.brand_grouping`; uncited normalization is a
  contract violation.
- Group keys: `{brand, line}`. `brand` may be the extractor's literal
  `"unknown"` — reported as its own row, never merged or dropped.
- **Zero-row comparison set:** a readout may emit `mention_count: 0` rows for
  unobserved brand/line keys ONLY when it carries a declared `comparison_set`
  (`brand_line_keys`, `basis`, `comparison_set_ref` or manifest, and policy
  version in `selection_policy_versions`). Without that field, rows are
  observed keys only — the absence of a row is not a zero, and a zero row can
  never be invented for a cherry-picked competitor.

## Numerator / Denominator / Share Fields

- `mention_count` (numerator, per `{brand, line}` row): count of MENTION-LEVEL
  entries in `source_backed_complete` `silver__cleaning__product_mentions`
  records within scope. Each row must carry `mention_refs`: dereferenceable
  committed mention refs (`raw_anchor`, `lane`, `record_id`, `sha256`,
  `mention_id`, `source_pointer`, `start_ms`, `end_ms`) — every counted
  mention clicks back to transcript evidence. Record-level refs alone are
  insufficient: when one committed record contains multiple matching
  mentions, each matching mention emits its own ref, and
  `mention_count == len(mention_refs)` must hold exactly.
- `denominator`: total mentions across all rows in the same scope, with
  mandatory `denominator_basis: "captured_source_backed_mentions_only"`. No
  field may ever represent a market total, uncaptured population, or
  extrapolated reach — such fields are unrepresentable in this family, not
  optional.
- `share`: derived (`mention_count / denominator`), and must recompute exactly
  from the row's own numerator and the readout's denominator — a stored share
  that cannot be recomputed from cited refs fails the family's
  rebuildability/honesty check.
- **Zero semantics:** `share: 0` (equivalently `mention_count: 0`) is valid
  ONLY as a real observed zero — the scope has a non-empty source-backed
  denominator and this brand/line genuinely has no mentions in it. An empty
  scope is a posture, never a zero (below).

## Coverage Fields (required block; prevents thin-scope readouts)

`coverage`: `{packets_in_scope, packets_with_transcripts,
mention_records_in_scope, mention_records_excluded_not_source_backed,
window_basis_missing (when window_basis is source_publication_time),
source_objects_in_scope, source_objects_with_transcripts,
source_backed_records_with_zero_mentions, cohort_selection_residuals}` — the
counts a reader needs to judge how much captured evidence stands behind the
shares. Excluded non-source-backed records are counted residuals (seam
contract lineage gate), never silently dropped and never evidence. Records
missing the selected window basis are counted separately from lineage-gate
exclusions, so a publication-time readout cannot hide denominator shrinkage
behind a generic coverage count. `source_objects_in_scope` must reconcile to
the cohort's `member_refs` / `cohort_manifest_ref`.

## Posture Semantics

- Posture vocabulary binds to the Silver Vault closed set
  (`observed` / `unavailable_with_reason` / `not_attempted`) with the
  contract's value/reason coupling: a non-observed posture carries a reason
  and NO numeric value.
- Readout-level posture: a scope with `denominator = 0` (no source-backed
  mentions at all) yields `readout_posture: unavailable_with_reason` (e.g.
  `no_source_backed_mentions_in_scope`) and NO share rows — never a table of
  zeros.
- Any per-object metric embedded in a SoV readout (e.g. observed view counts
  accompanying a mention ref) carries its own `MetricObservation` posture
  unchanged — a SoV view never launders a non-observed metric into a number.

## Forbidden Fields (unrepresentable, not just discouraged)

Cross-platform aggregation or identity fields; market-total / total-reach /
"social share of market" denominators; ROI, sales-lift, or EMV fields;
person-level or dossier fields; any share computed over records failing the
lineage gate. A view schema containing any of these fails this contract.

## View-Build Gate Disposition

This artifact satisfies the seam contract's field-level gate for
`source_backed_brand_line_share_of_voice`. A SoV view build is now
gate-unblocked but remains a separate bounded work unit under the seam
contract's rules: rebuildable manifest-backed cache under
`indexes/derived_retrieval/`, on-demand-first posture, prove-rebuildability
compliant, and never authoritative. `movement_threshold_crossings` remains
gate-blocked.

## Non-Claims

Not validation, readiness, acceptance, view-build execution, engine/backend
selection, capture authorization, cohort selection, or brand canonicalization.
Records the field-level contract only.

    Adjudicated amendment pass (2026-07-03) closing the accepted findings of
    the repo-mode cross-vendor delegated review (OpenAI GPT-5 Codex, pinned
    commit cf43db5f): (F1) mention-LEVEL refs required (mention_id +
    source_pointer + start_ms/end_ms per counted mention;
    mention_count == len(mention_refs) exactly) so shares are mechanically
    recomputable when one record carries multiple matching mentions; (F2)
    window-basis inclusion rules bound — source_publication_time evaluates
    only records carrying publication/event timing evidence, missing-basis
    records are excluded from numerator AND denominator and counted under
    coverage.window_basis_missing, all-missing scopes go
    unavailable_with_reason; (F3) cohorts gain member_refs/cohort_manifest_ref
    reconciling to coverage.source_objects_in_scope, selection_policy_versions
    gains cohort_selection, and zero rows for unobserved keys require a
    declared source-backed comparison_set (absence of a row is not a zero);
    (F4) silver_lineage_gate bound to the live literal
    "source_backed_complete"; coverage block expanded (window_basis_missing,
