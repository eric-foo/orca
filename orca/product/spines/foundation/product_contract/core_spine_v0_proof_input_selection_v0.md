# Core Spine v0 Proof Input Selection

- Status: PROPOSED_FREEZE
- Artifact type: Product proof input selection
- Scope: Selected inputs for the first Core Spine v0 proof protocol run
- Source basis: current owner direction, `docs/product/core_spine_v0_product_contract.md`, `orca/product/shared/engagement_registry/engagement_logic_registry_v0.md`, `docs/product/core_spine_v0_proof_protocol_v0.md`
- Implementation authorized: no
- Feature planning authorized: no
- Proof run authorized: no

## Purpose

This artifact records the selected end-goal inputs for the first Core Spine v0
proof protocol run.

It does not claim Orca can run the proof yet. The current gap is that Orca has
not yet defined the docs-first information-generation and inference foundation
needed to produce evidence units (EvidenceUnit), signal integrity judgments, signal use
classification, decision strength, and memo outputs.

## Selected Proof Input Set

| Input | Selection |
| --- | --- |
| Primary non-`jb` shadow satellite | Competitor narrative response |
| Backup shadow satellite | Buyer-objection remediation |
| Backtest policy | One pre-registered, leakage-controlled historical case (Case) |
| Confidence/action vocabulary | Qualitative Action Ceiling |
| Proof-readiness verdict | End-goal selected; proof run not yet ready |

## Selected Shadow Satellite

Primary: competitor narrative response.

Frame it narrowly as one buyer-visible narrative pressure case, not broad
competitor monitoring.

Decision question:

> Should the decision owner monitor, defend, reposition, or test a response to
> a competitor narrative that appears to be gaining market traction?

This satellite is selected because it stresses Core Spine v0 outside the `jb`
finance-career context:

- actor strategy versus buyer pull;
- buyer-visible belief;
- copied language and campaign repetition;
- artificial amplification risk;
- source integrity under narrative pressure;
- action thresholds below commitment.

## Backup Shadow Satellite

Backup: buyer-objection remediation.

Use it only if a competitor narrative response case cannot show buyer-visible
consequence or clean pre-cutoff source visibility.

## Downgraded Satellite Options

| Option | Reason downgraded |
| --- | --- |
| Pricing/package change | Strong economic consequence, but overlaps with the `jb` Client 0 pricing/package question. |
| Product roadmap / feature gap | Risks feature-planning drift before the proof protocol validates Core Spine. |
| Growth-channel prioritization | Too vulnerable to generic OSINT/source-volume drift in v0. |
| Category entry | Too broad and likely to produce hindsight stories or source bloat. |
| Positioning shift | Useful, but less adversarially rich than competitor narrative response for this first proof. |

## Backtest Policy

Use one pre-registered, leakage-controlled historical case.

Internal proof rules:

- select the case by policy before evidence interpretation;
- freeze a cutoff date before the outcome was obvious;
- use only public evidence visible or discoverable before the cutoff;
- record excluded post-window evidence;
- preserve misses, overconfidence, underconfidence, and inconclusive results;
- do not let cherry-picked marketing demos train the internal evidence
  standard.

Marketing examples may be selected later, but they must be labeled as marketing
demos and separated from internal calibration.

## Action Ceiling Vocabulary

Use qualitative Action Ceiling language instead of numeric confidence scores.

| Ceiling | Allowed action |
| --- | --- |
| Excluded | Ignore for recommendation, or record as manipulation/source-quality evidence. |
| Watch | Monitor. |
| Probe | Investigate. |
| Test | Run a reversible test; delay irreversible commitment. |
| Hold | Delay, narrow, or withhold action because counterevidence or integrity risk is material. |
| Move | Reposition or defend with bounded scope. |
| Commit | Invest or commit only when costly behavior, independence, audience fit, counterevidence handling, and consequence are all strong. |

Required memo phrasing should include:

- signal use;
- signal integrity state;
- evidence strength;
- counterevidence;
- uncertainty;
- action ceiling.

Example:

> competitor-strategy evidence; source-limited; directional; counterevidence
> material; ceiling: Probe/Test.

## What This Selection Proves

This selection proves only that the proof protocol now has a target input set.

It does not prove:

- Core Spine v0 works;
- the shadow satellite has enough evidence;
- the backtest case is selected;
- Orca can yet generate the evidence and inference needed for the proof run;
- feature planning or implementation is ready.

## Next Foundation Gap

Before running the proof protocol, Orca needs a docs-first information
production foundation that defines how an operator or agent should produce:

- evidence units;
- signal integrity assessments;
- signal use classifications;
- decision strength assessments;
- action ceilings;
- decision memo (Memo) outputs;
- backtest records.

This foundation should stay manual and docs-first. It should not design
scrapers, databases, dashboards, scoring engines, automation runtimes, or
implementation architecture.

## Current Verdict

Current verdict: `NEEDS_FOUNDATION_ARTIFACT`.

The selected proof inputs are accepted as a target. The proof run should wait
until Orca has a product-level information production foundation.
