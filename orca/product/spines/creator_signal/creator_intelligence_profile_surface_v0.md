# Creator Intelligence Profile Surface v0

```yaml

artifact_role: product_signal_surface_contract
scope: >
  Product-facing surface contract for the one-stop creator intelligence profile:
  how Orca operators or buyers may view observed public accounts or linked
  creator/account clusters, aggregate influence, ideal/content-fit audience
  signal, freshness, limitations, and source drill-back over the Capture-owned
  creator_profile_current view.
use_when:
  - Designing or reviewing the creator profile product surface.
  - Deciding what aggregate creator influence or ideal-audience fields may appear in a buyer/operator view.
  - Checking whether a proposed creator profile claim is allowed or must be withheld.

## Status

`OWNER_ACCEPTED_PRODUCT_SURFACE_CONTRACT_V0`.

This is the first promoted Creator Signal surface contract. It is docs/product
only. It does not create a dashboard, storage engine, live capture flow, real
creator rows, buyer proof, or runtime implementation.

## Product job

The surface gives an Orca operator or buyer one current, source-backed profile
for an observed public account or creator/account cluster:

```text
Who is this observed account or creator/account cluster?
Where are the public accounts?
What aggregate influence is source-backed and fresh enough to show?
What ideal/content-fit audience signal is allowed to show?
What is missing, stale, gated, or not claimed?
Where can the operator drill back to the source rows?
```

This is a product interpretation over `creator_profile_current`, not a new source
of truth.

## Ownership split

Capture owns:

- `creator_public_handle_linkage_ledger_v0.json` and account-link evidence;
- metric observation rows for individual reels/videos/profile facts;
- metric rollup records for average views, engagement rate, cadence, velocity,
  and similar aggregate measures;
- ideal-audience profile snapshots and their source evidence;
- the derived `creator_profile_current` view and its join/denormalization
  mechanics.

Creator Signal owns:

- first-screen information architecture and section ordering;
- operator/buyer decision language for creator fit and aggregate influence;
- claim-withhold rules for product presentation;
- required limitation, missingness, freshness, and source-drill-back display;
- product-facing non-claims.

## Required surface sections

A conforming creator intelligence profile surface has these sections or their
functional equivalent:

| Section | Required contents | Source owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity and account cluster | `profile_subject_kind`, `profile_subject_id`, `identity_state` (`single_platform_observed` or the linkage-ledger `link_state` when present), `platform_account_id` when account-scoped, `creator_record_id_or_none` when linked, link/review state when present, public platform handles, linkage evidence summary | Capture identity linkage |
| Aggregate influence | Latest allowed rollups by platform/window: average views, engagement rate, median views, cadence, recent velocity when present | Capture metric rollups |
| Ideal/content-fit audience | Latest allowed Tier-1 ideal-audience profile fields: segment, audience_role, purchase_intent, skill_level, price_tier, with support bands and evidence pointers | Capture ideal-audience inference + ballot taxonomy |
| Freshness | identity update timestamp, metric computation timestamp, audience computation timestamp, profile view computation timestamp, stale/partial/blocked state | Capture current view |
| Limitations and missingness | unavailable metrics, hidden counts, blocked access, thin evidence, stale windows, gated Tier-2-A demographics, abstentions | Source owner for each row |
| Source drill-back | links/pointers to identity, metric observation, metric rollup, audience snapshot, and packet/data-lake records when available | Capture/Data Lake as applicable |

## Aggregate influence rules

Average views, engagement rate, and similar influence facts may appear only when
they come from `creator_metric_rollup` or a successor accepted rollup home.

The surface must show or make available:

- rollup window;
- platform scope;
- source observation set or drill-back pointer;
- calculation recipe/version;
- `computed_at`;
- freshness state;
- limitations and missing-data posture;
- sample support and representativeness posture.

The surface must withhold or downgrade an influence summary when source windows
are stale, input rows are blocked/hidden/absent, rollup recipe is missing, sample
support is thin, the rollup is admitted-pool-only without visible limitation, or
the claim would be unstamped, sourceless, or LLM-only.

## Ideal-audience rules

Use **ideal audience** as a content-fit claim: who the creator's public content is
best fit for or pitched at. Do not call it the creator's intent and do not call it
the actual audience.

Allowed Tier-1 fields are owned by the audience-inference spec and ballot
taxonomy:

- `segment`
- `audience_role`
- `purchase_intent`
- `skill_level`
- `price_tier`

Tier-2-A demographic fields such as gender/age remain gated until an accepted
aggregate-audience-attribute schema home and sourced base-rate/data prerequisites
exist. Until then, show them as unavailable/gated or omit them. Never infer
actual audience demographics from this surface.

## Allowed product claims

Allowed claim shape:

- source-backed linked public accounts;
- source-backed observed single-platform public accounts labeled as account-scoped;
- source-backed aggregate influence for a named platform/window;
- current or stale posture for identity, metrics, and audience fields;
- ideal/content-fit audience profile with support band and evidence pointers;
- explicit limitations and non-claims;
- operator-facing summary that is derived from the visible fields and source
  stamps.

The surface may use a wind-calling or creator-fit summary only as an operator
summary over stamped inputs. It is not buyer proof, validation, a performance
prediction, or a guarantee.

## Forbidden product claims

The surface must not provide or imply:

- contact/outreach authorization;
- lead-list export;
- public person-level directory;
- legal-name or real-world identity proof;
- follower graph or individual audience-member retention;
- actual-audience demographics unless a later accepted schema and data gate
  authorize an aggregate slice;
- unstamped, sourceless, or LLM-only influence claims;
- hidden/blocked/not-applicable metrics as observed zeroes;
- candidate public-account links as final linked creator identities or
  cross-platform aggregate influence before human review promotes or rejects
  them;
- buyer proof, validation, readiness, commercial usefulness, or guaranteed
  creator performance;
- live capture, source-access, dashboard, SQLite, or data-lake job readiness.

## First-screen guidance

A first screen should favor scanability over completeness:

1. Profile subject, identity state, and review/link state.
2. Platform accounts.
3. Aggregate influence snapshot by platform/window.
4. Ideal/content-fit audience snapshot.
5. Freshness and limitations.
6. Source drill-back.

Detailed per-content reels/videos stay below the fold or in drill-back. They are
not copied into the identity ledger or into this surface contract as source truth.

## Physicalization and testing sequence

The first static `creator_profile_current` export may test source-backed identity
rows, metric observations, and metric rollups against this surface before a
storage engine or dashboard exists. The durable target is a generated read model
over Silver Vault creator metric observations and derived rollups, as mapped in
`creator_profile_current_lake_native_record_mapping_v0.md`.

The correct next sequence remains:

1. Test source-backed real identity rows, metric observations, metric rollups, and
   ideal-audience snapshots against this surface.
2. Pressure-test missingness, blocked metrics, stale windows, cross-platform link
   ambiguity, and thin audience evidence.
3. Promote to SQLite, data-lake jobs, or a dashboard implementation only after
   the sibling record shapes survive those real rows and failure cases.

## Non-claims

This surface contract is not validation, readiness, buyer proof, product proof,
SQLite adoption, data-lake job authorization, dashboard implementation, live
capture authorization, source-access authorization, public directory, outreach,
contact enrichment, or lead-list authorization.
