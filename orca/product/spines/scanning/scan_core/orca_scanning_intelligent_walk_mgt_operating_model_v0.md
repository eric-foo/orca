# Orca Scanning Intelligent Walk MGT Operating Model v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Product method operating model (owner-invoked Mini God Tier target lens; scanning-to-capture bridge)
scope: >
  Defines the high-signal scanning target shape the owner invoked as Mini God
  Tier: bounded intelligent walks, frontier selection, branch decay/pivot
  discipline, CSB-first venue-value evaluation, exact-query discovery,
  hidden-venue discovery, precursor-signal handling, minimum evidence for
  promotion, shared scan
  vocabulary, and the capture-request handoff from scanning to the Capture
  spine. Bridges the
  Vertical Exploration Guide, the PROPOSED Demand Scan-Core Spec, and
  source-family lanes without ratifying scan-core, authorizing live scans, or
  moving packet-grade acquisition into scanning.
use_when:
  - Designing or reviewing a scanning lane that should behave like a high-signal bounded walker rather than a generic crawler.
  - Evaluating whether CSB-surfaced venues are worth downstream attention and whether hidden venues were missed.
  - Running bounded exact-query discovery to test CSB rows, find hidden venues, or record decisive negatives.
  - Deciding what scanning may emit before Capture, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, or gate-run work begins.
  - Distinguishing precursor signals and precursor surfaces from gate proof, capture authority, or standing source maps.
  - Normalizing source-family lane outputs into shared scanning vocabulary and capture-request handoffs.

  - The Vertical Exploration Guide changes its walk contract, dry rule, or capture seam.
  - The Demand Scan-Core Spec is owner-adjudicated or amended on walk order, observation schema, or capture-needs handoff.
  - A capture-owned request/route-binding contract supersedes the capture_request fields below.
  - A venue registry, atlas, crawler, monitor, or standing source-map decision is reopened by the owner.

## Status

`MGT_TARGET_OWNER_INVOKED` - owner-invoked in-thread 2026-06-21 for scanning.
This is a capability-target lens and operating model only. It is not
validation, readiness, scan-core ratification, scan authorization, capture
authorization, gate clearance, or buyer proof.

The product impulse may be described casually as a "smart crawler," but the
operating vocabulary here is **bounded intelligent walk**. "Crawler" is avoided
as source vocabulary because Orca's standing crawler / monitor / registry /
atlas shapes are explicitly out of bounds unless a later owner decision reopens
them.

## Target Shape

Scanning should spend most of its read budget on value-bearing or
value-routing venues: the surfaces CSB nominated, exact public queries that can
find or disqualify venues, hidden venues CSB missed, independent-origin leads,
contradictions, high-quality pointers, decisive negatives, access notes, and
only those precursor surfaces that change the next route. It is not optimized
for exhaustive coverage.

Target loop:

```text
authorized seed / objective
-> CSB board or owner-authorized seed
-> bounded intelligent walk over venues
-> frontier-selected venue reads and exact-query probes
-> venue-value notes / exact-query negatives / hidden-venue pointers
-> lightweight observations
-> minimum-evidence promotion
-> capture request
-> capture spine acquisition
-> gate-run adjudication
```

The MGT bet is that this captures most of the value of a maximal crawler-like
system without accepting the infrastructure, maintenance, policy, and
source-drift cost of standing crawl machinery.

## Hard Boundaries

Scanning does not own:

- standing crawlers, monitors, source maps, registries, or atlases;
- packet-grade capture, manifests, ECR, screenshots, raw preservation, or route
  expansion;
- capture route binding or source-access policy decisions;
- replacing the demand gate with collection quotas;
- full-schema burden on every exploratory move;
- contact, outreach, lead-list, follower-graph, comment-scraping,
  channel-dossier, person-dossier, or standing creator-monitoring work.

Scanning owns, inside an authorized run:

- choosing the next public read by expected decision value;
- producing screen-light summaries, short quotes, precursor signals, precursor
  surfaces, venue evaluations, hidden-venue pointers, negatives, access notes,
  and candidate observations;
- preserving dated provenance for what was tried and why;
- emitting capture requests that tell Capture what to inspect and what the
  scan thinks that inspection could support.

## Frontier Selection

A frontier is a next-read candidate: a URL, venue, search phrase, hub, thread,
byline trail, source-family surface, or cross-reference the walk may inspect.

Choose the next frontier by expected decision value, not by crawl coverage.
High-value reasons include:

- likely value of a CSB-nominated venue for this decision;
- likely hidden venue or surface that CSB missed;
- exact query likely to reveal a hidden venue, better origin, or decisive negative;
- likely precursor surface that may reveal better origins or candidates;
- likely independent demand-origin signal;
- likely gradeable costly-behavior evidence;
- likely contradiction, divergence, or defeater;
- likely pointer to a better venue or origin;
- freshness inside the decision window;
- likely decision-owner or org-motion context;
- low access/policy risk relative to expected value;
- decisive negative value, where ruling it out changes the scan route.

The scan records why a frontier was selected when that reason is load-bearing.
This reason is a steering explanation, not a score or proof.

Precursor is a venue-routing concept here. Do not relabel ordinary weak
owned/channel/editorial evidence as a precursor just because it falls below the
candidate bar. If the item mainly tells the operator whether a venue is useful,
record it as venue value, pointer, negative, access note, or unknown.

## Exact Query Discovery

An `exact_query` is a bounded public query string crafted to test a CSB row,
find a hidden venue, reach a better origin surface, or produce a decisive
negative. Exact-query discovery belongs to scanning because it is part of
frontier selection and venue-value evaluation.

Rules:

- count each exact query plus first-pass result inspection against the run cap;
- record the query string, intent, retrieval date, result class, and next-route
  decision when it changes the walk;
- when the row is creator/social or influence-related, public YouTube video and
  Shorts result pages are allowed screening routes if reachable without login
  and selected inside the run cap;
- emit discovered venues as `hidden_venue_pointer`, weak/no-yield results as
  `negative`, and access/policy walls as `access_note`;
- do not treat query count, search rank, AEO visibility, or repeated SERP
  presence as demand proof;
- do not turn exact queries into a standing query monitor, search-volume model,
  SEO keyword surface, crawler, or registry.

## Branch Decay, Pivot, And Stop

Do not stop at the first sign of signal degradation. Walk through degradation
while marginal expected value remains non-trivial. When an active branch decays,
pivot to the best remaining frontier or to a different direction if that route
has higher expected value.

Stop when one of these fires:

- the authorized target is met;
- the run budget, cap, or source-policy boundary is reached;
- all declared and discovered frontiers have decayed to minimal or zero
  expected value;
- the remaining path would require standing monitoring, bulk access,
  auth-gated data, packet-grade capture, or a capture-owned route decision;
- the current guide or run-specific walk contract fires a hard stop that this
  operating model did not explicitly supersede.

For ordinary vertical walks, the Vertical Exploration Guide's dry rule remains
the default. For explicitly declared MGT / intelligent-walk scans with multiple
frontiers, dry handling is branch-aware: repeated dry moves close the active
branch; they do not automatically end the whole run while another declared or
freshly surfaced frontier has non-trivial expected value and the run remains
inside caps.

A scan is **explicitly declared** MGT when the scan authorization or commission
document invokes this operating model and the branch-aware rule by name. The
declaration must appear in the authorizing commission, not be asserted at
runtime by the walk itself. An authorized scan that does not carry an explicit
MGT declaration uses the ordinary dry rule.

A **run cap** (move budget, read limit, or equivalent) must be stated in any
MGT scan commission. Caps are the primary enforcement mechanism that makes
branch-aware pivot behavior bounded rather than open-ended. A scan commission
without a stated cap does not qualify as a bounded intelligent walk under this
model and must not invoke the branch-aware dry rule.

## Shared Vocabulary

Source-family lanes should emit into this vocabulary instead of inventing
separate downstream shapes:

- `frontier` - a candidate next read and its reason;
- `move` - one bounded read or attempted read;
- `exact_query` - a bounded public query string used to test a CSB row, find a
  hidden venue, reach a better origin, or produce a decisive negative;
- `precursor_signal` - an early, URL-backed clue that may guide a walk but is
  tied to a venue or surface worth probing; not proof, gate clearance, or
  capture authorization;
- `precursor_surface` - a venue, hub, thread, search, AEO surface, source-family
  surface, or cross-reference that produced or likely produces precursor
  signals inside an authorized run; not a registry, atlas, monitor, or standing
  source map;
- `venue_eval` - a screen-light assessment of whether a CSB-nominated or
  discovered venue is worth more retrieval, capture, or exclusion for this
  commission;
- `hidden_venue_pointer` - a URL, venue, hub, or source-family surface not
  surfaced by the starting CSB board but worth returning to CSB, scanning, or
  Capture as a route candidate;
- `candidate` - possible target/company/topic worth carrying forward;
- `observation` - screen-light evidence or contradiction tied to a URL;
- `pointer` - a URL, venue, byline, hub, or cross-reference likely to improve
  the next read;
- `negative` - checked path with decisive low/no yield;
- `access_note` - public access constraint and shapes tried;
- `influence_obs` - hub, pointing structure, public creator-video pointer,
  wind-caller, or detector signal;
- `gate_role` - what demand-gate role the observation might support, if any;
- `capture_request` - scanning's request for Capture to inspect specified
  URLs for specified observations.

These terms are screen-light. They do not mint ECR, Cleaning, Judgment,
claim-ladder, packet, buyer-proof vocabulary, source-access authority, or gate
proof.

## Minimum Evidence, Not Quotas

Quotas are collection hygiene, not inference. A scan may set collection
coverage targets, but a quota does not decide whether demand is real, durable,
manufactured, or action-worthy.

Promote a move note to an observation when the signal is worth carrying for
downstream gate or capture evaluation: it ties to a specific URL and a possible
gate role, decision window, or candidate. Do not promote every observed item;
do not suppress signal that may support a candidate entry.

`signal_stage` names what the scan currently thinks the item is doing.
`gate_role` remains separate: a precursor may have no gate role yet, and a
possible gate role does not turn the precursor into proof.

Minimum promotion from move note to observation:

```yaml
observation_id:
source_move_id:
url:
retrieval_date:
short_quote_or_summary:
signal_stage: venue_value | precursor | candidate_support | contradiction | negative | access_note | unknown
claim_it_might_support:
gate_role: none | demand_origin | costly_behavior | divergence | org_motion | decision_event | influence
independence_hypothesis:
uncertainty_or_limits:
```

Minimum promotion from observation to candidate observation:

```yaml
candidate_observation_id:
candidate:
supporting_observations: []
why_promoted:
decision_window:
competing_or_defeating_observations: []
capture_needed: yes | no | unknown
```

The richer Demand Scan-Core schema remains the right home when an authorized
scan has enough signal to emit a candidate entry. It should not be forced onto
every low-level move.

## Capture Request Contract

Scanning hands Capture a request, not a route.

Emit a `capture_request` only when the observation needs Capture-owned action,
not merely because a venue produced a non-empty clue. At least one must be true:

- the source state is volatile or time-sensitive enough that packet-grade
  preservation could matter;
- the next useful read is blocked by a source-access, entitlement, or
  route-binding boundary that scanning must not cross;
- a promoted or near-promoted candidate-support observation needs Capture to
  preserve provenance before gate use;
- a hidden venue is high-yield enough that Capture-owned acquisition is the
  right next action, not another screen-light scan move.

Do not emit a capture request for ordinary owned-only chronology, retailer
presence, editorial visibility, AEO visibility, or weak precursor material
unless one of the triggers above is explicitly satisfied.

```yaml
capture_request_id:
source_scan:
candidate_or_observation_ids: []
urls:
  - url:
    venue:
    observation_supported:
    gate_role:
what_capture_should_verify:
decision_window:
route_binding_state: cited_current | unknown | blocked_outside_current_binding | not_applicable
screening_evidence_summary:
uncertainty_or_access_limits:
not_requested:
  - route expansion
  - packet commitment by scanning
  - ECR, Cleaning, or Judgment work
```

Capture decides route binding, entitlement/source policy, acquisition method,
packet-grade preservation, manifests, and packet lifecycle. The scan may cite a
known current binding or say `unknown`; it must not set, stretch, or recommend
the route.

## Gate Packaging

Scanning and the demand gate are different operations, but they should be
packaged as one efficient commission where authorized:

```text
scan with origination provenance -> in-session gate-run -> verdict / cap / hold
```

The gate remains the inference layer. It answers whether the collected evidence
clears de-correlation, costly behavior, integrity/divergence, and action
ceiling. Scanning supplies dated provenance and observations; it does not
replace the gate with raw source counts.

## Source-Family Adapter Rule

Reddit, LinkedIn, answer-engine/search, trade press, forums, trackers, review
surfaces, and future source families may keep local guardrails. Their
downstream scanning output should still map into the same shared terms:
`frontier`, `move`, `exact_query`, `precursor_signal`, `precursor_surface`,
`observation`, `pointer`, `venue_eval`, `hidden_venue_pointer`, `negative`,
`access_note`, `capture_request`, and `gate_role`.

Local restrictions always carry. Examples:

- Reddit screening reads remain orchestrator-mediated and screen-light.
- LinkedIn remains planning-only under its hard privacy and no-contact rails
  unless a separate owner-authorized mode applies.
- Search-interest / AEO remains proposed and gap-bound until owner-approved
  sourcing and schema placement land.
- Public YouTube videos and Shorts are allowed as screen-light creator/social
  routes when reachable without login and chosen by frontier/exact-query logic;
  record the video or Short URL, retrieval date, visible dated call/context, and
  campaign/affiliate caveat. Do not scrape comments, enumerate channels, build
  subscriber/follower graphs, create channel/person dossiers, or monitor
  creators. TikTok/Instagram live reads remain separately authorized.

## Accepted Residuals

These residuals are accepted for the MGT target. They are the price paid to
avoid the rejected maximal infrastructure.

| Residual | Why acceptable now | Remaining risk | Upgrade trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Long-tail miss risk | No standing crawl or exhaustive atlas keeps cost and policy risk low. | Some useful sources will be missed. | Repeated missed-source postmortems or sustained scan throughput bottleneck. |
| Rediscovery cost | Append-only provenance and card-set promotion cover reuse without maintaining a general registry. | Operators may revisit known venues before a trigger fires. | Same vertical third screen, multi-operator cadence, or sustained weekly cadence per the guide. |
| Capture re-fetch | Capture must re-acquire under its own provenance discipline. | Duplicate fetch effort and possible source drift between scan and capture. | Capture owns a formal request intake or freshness-preserving acquisition handoff. |
| Judgment-dependent frontier choice | Human/agent judgment gives high signal without building crawler ranking infrastructure. | Frontier selection may be inconsistent across operators. | Repeated low-yield scans from poor frontier ordering. |
| Full schema deferred until promotion | Lightweight moves keep exploration fast. | Some weak signals may be under-structured until promoted. | Review finds promoted observations lack fields needed for gate or capture. |
| Source-family gaps cap ceilings | Review surfaces, search-interest, and AEO are not all sourced or gate-recordable today. | Some candidates stay hold/low-commitment or gap-tagged. | Owner adjudicates source-class cards and capture bindings. |
| No readiness claim | This is an operating model, not proof. | The shape may still need review, live rehearsal, and source-family tuning. | Owner asks for ratification, first scan commission, or validation evidence. |

## Non-Claims

Not validation, readiness, buyer proof, gate clearance, scan authorization,
capture authorization, scan-core ratification, source-family adoption, crawler
approval, monitor approval, registry approval, or live web access permission.
No implementation, scheduler, crawler, dashboard, storage layer, packet runner,
ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, outreach, or buyer-contact work is authorized here.
