  Retrieval-only entry point for the scanning spine: load order, file classes,

  phase, recency/current-state priority, exact-query discovery,
  precursor-signal placement, and bloat-control boundaries.
use_when:
  - Starting any scanning-lane task cold.
  - Starting or reviewing a CSB-first scan.
  - Deciding which scanning source to open before source-family or capture work.

## Load Order

1. Start from a Commission Signal Board output when one exists. If no CSB
   board exists and the task is not an owner-authorized seed-first probe,
   commission CSB first; scanning should not silently invent the board shape.
   Every CSB-first scan then runs a bounded broad-scout phase by default before
   or alongside main deepening.
2. Open the MGT intelligent-walk operating model for shared scanning
   vocabulary, branch-aware walking, default broad-scout rules, recency-first
   frontier ordering, venue-value evaluation, exact-query discovery,
   hidden-venue discovery, precursor handling, and capture-request boundaries.
3. Open the Demand Scan-Core Spec only when the work needs rich promoted
   observation schema, gate preparation, or backward/forward scan-mode detail.
4. Open source-family adapters only for local restrictions: Reddit, LinkedIn,
   answer-engine/search, or future families.
5. Open Capture sources only when a `capture_request` or source-access wall is
   present. Scanning cites route state; Capture owns route binding.

## File Classes

| Class | Files | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core method front door | `scan_core/orca_scanning_intelligent_walk_mgt_operating_model_v0.md` | Bounded intelligent walk, precursor vocabulary, minimum evidence, capture-request bridge. |
| Proposed rich schema | `scan_core/orca_demand_scan_core_spec_v0.md` | Candidate-observation schema and gate-prep detail after signal promotion. |
| Adjudication / support | `admissibility_checkability/*.md` | Gate-definition and scan-core decision surfaces. |
| Source-family adapters | `source_families/*/*.md` | Local guardrails mapped into shared scanning vocabulary. |
| Research / probe evidence | `docs/research/answer_engine/aeo_capture_feasibility_probe_phase0_v0.md` | AEO feasibility evidence; not product-spine authority. |

## Shared Output Vocabulary

Scanning emits screen-light `frontier`, `move`, `exact_query`,
`broad_scout_return`, `precursor_signal`, `precursor_surface`, `observation`,
`candidate`, `pointer`, `negative`, `access_note`, `influence_obs`,
`venue_eval`, `hidden_venue_pointer`, and `capture_request` records.

CSB supplies the starting source-family and signal-route board. Scanning then
tests which venues are actually valuable for the commissioned decision and
whether any high-yield venue or surface was hidden from the board.

For every CSB-first scan, the broad-scout phase is mandatory by default and
bounded by the commission's caps. It may run as one route-ledger subagent when
subagents are available, or inline when they are not. Its job is to miss-check
the board: public buyer-language venues, hidden venues, exact-query risks,
decisive negatives, access walls, and obvious recency/current-state changes.
It does not mint candidates, clear gates, bind Capture routes, or authorize
source expansion. Main scanning owns deepening and final candidate decisions.

After CSB routes and hard stops, scanning treats recency/currentness as an
attention-priority signal. For same-strength URL-backed signals, a newer or
current source should normally receive more scan attention than an older source,
even when their direction differs. Prioritize current official or retailer state,
dated buyer language, recent reviews or threads, recent stockout/restock or
availability changes, and recent editorial, partner, or org-motion pointers.
Older sources remain useful for provenance, chronology, or baseline
contradiction, but they should be labeled as historical/contextual and must not
override fresh current-state reads without a load-bearing reason.

Exact-query discovery belongs to scanning. It is a bounded public-query walk
used to test CSB rows, find hidden venues, and record pointers, negatives, or
access notes. It is not search-volume proof, AEO proof, SEO keyword research,
a standing query monitor, or a crawler substitute.

Public-reaction engagement context is a scan-routing input. If a scan observes
source-visible upvotes, helpful votes, likes, views, shares, comment counts,
reply counts, source-native score state, visible sort/rank/order, or
pinned/hearted/official-response markers, it should treat them as qualitative
resonance context by default and may use them to prioritize a frontier, explain
venue value, or request Capture preservation. Direction, visible audience fit,
baseline context, manipulation risk, and ambiguity decide how much routing
priority the context deserves. Scanning must not turn those metrics into demand
proof, credibility, independence, amplification, gate clearance, graph weight,
final resonance weight, or Action Ceiling. Source-family adapters with explicit
counts, visibility, rank, or influence fields inherit this boundary.

Before closeout, a fresh CSB-first scan artifact must pass
`.agents/hooks/check_csb_scanning_artifact.py` or record why the checker was not
run. CI also runs the checker in forward-only diff mode for changed
`docs/research/` artifacts that look like CSB-first scan outputs. The checker
enforces receipt shape and mechanical public-reaction overclaim language only:
source context, caps, broad-scout accounting, CSB-row accountability,
exact-query accounting, venue/hidden-venue accounting, observations,
negatives/access notes, capture-request accounting, candidate closeout, and
explicit engagement/resonance shortcuts into proof, gate clearance, route
binding, graph weight, credibility, amplification, Action Ceiling, or final
resonance weight. It does not grade signal quality, prove buyer demand,
validate candidates, or bind Capture routes.

`precursor_signal` and `precursor_surface` are routing inputs. They may steer a
walk or explain why a venue deserves inspection. They are not a generic label
for every weak clue. They do not prove demand, clear a gate, authorize capture,
or create a standing source map.

## Boundary

The scanning spine is not a crawler, monitor, registry, atlas, capture runner,
ECR lane, Cleaning lane, Judgment lane, outreach lane, or buyer-contact system.
The default broad-scout phase is a bounded scan step, not a standing crawl or a
runtime mandate that every environment must provide subagents.
When a source-family doc repeats that boundary, prefer pointing back here and to
the MGT hard boundaries while preserving source-specific hard stops.

## Direction Change Propagation

```yaml
direction_change_propagation:
  doctrine_changed: >
    CSB-first scans now run a bounded broad-scout phase by default, and scanning
    treats recency/currentness as an attention-priority signal: same-strength
    newer/current signals normally receive more scan attention than older context.
    Broad scout may use a route-ledger subagent when available, but the default
    is the bounded phase, not a hard runtime dependency on subagent infrastructure.
    Fresh CSB-first scan artifacts also have a portable receipt-shape checker
    with a forward-only CI diff mode for changed docs/research CSB-first scan
    outputs; the checker enforces reviewable structure, not scan quality or
    proof.

    The scanning spine now has a retrieval-only front door that routes source
    loading through CSB when a board exists, then the MGT intelligent-walk
    operating model. Scanning's primary role is venue-value evaluation,
    exact-query discovery, and hidden-venue discovery; precursor_signal and
    precursor_surface are reserved
    for venue/surface routing rather than generic weak evidence labels. The AEO
    Phase-0 probe artifacts live in research rather than product-spine
