"""Deletion-evidence gate (Phase-2 deletion safety) -- STRICT CI gate.

WHAT THIS DOES
  Fails (exit 1, --strict) when a GOVERNED artifact (one under GOVERNED_ROOTS)
  is deleted in this PR's diff without a complete evidence record in the
  deletion-evidence register. "Deleted" includes a rename that moves a governed
  artifact OUT of every governed root (it left its governed home); a rename that
  keeps it under a governed root is a move, not a deletion, and needs no record.

  The frozen Orca rule: a governed-artifact deletion is central-adjudicated and
  carries evidence -- reverse-reference check + successor + semantic delta +
  rollback. This gate makes the EVIDENCE mechanically mandatory on the pre-merge
  PR diff: a governed deletion with no complete record, or a successor that does
  not resolve in the committed tree, turns CI red, and a red rollup blocks both
  merge paths (the bot honors the router label; the self-merge guard requires a
  green rollup). SUBSTANTIVE adjudication -- is the recorded evidence true? -- is
  the human merger's job: the router routes every governed-deletion PR to
  `risk/manual-review-required`, and the protected-action guard refuses to
  self-merge a manual-flagged PR, so a human always reads the evidence.

WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT COVER (named boundaries)
  - It is a PRE-MERGE PR gate. A direct push to main is NOT caught (the push-event
    diff against origin/main is empty post-push); direct-push-to-main is a
    separate, bypassable control (.githooks/pre-push + the protected-action guard).
  - It enforces evidence PRESENCE + machine-checkable facts (targets match the
    diff; successor resolves as a committed file), NOT the truth of the
    human-judged fields -- that is the human adjudicator's job (above).

WHY STRICT (not report-mode)
  Report-mode (exit 0) gives no safety here: a green CI lets the self-merge
  guard land an unevidenced deletion. Only a red check closes that path. The
  gate is born GREEN -- with no governed deletions in a diff it exits 0 -- so
  adopting strict now matches the clean state without a red-main event (the
  strict predicate equals the report predicate on the current corpus).

WHY THE GOVERNED SCOPE IS CODE-OWNED
  GOVERNED_ROOTS lives here, not in the register, so the register (mutable data)
  cannot narrow or remove its own governance by being edited or deleted. The
  register holds deletion RECORDS only; this checker owns what is governed.

WHY PROVENANCE IS NOT IN THE RECORD
  Who deleted what, when, and in which commit is authoritatively recorded by
  git. The register holds only what git cannot derive: the human judgment
  evidence (reverse_ref_check, semantic_delta) and the declared successor /
  rollback. Single authoritative home per fact; smallest forgeable surface.

DETECTION CONTRACT (mirrors header_index.py --strict)
  base ref priority: $GITHUB_BASE_REF -> origin/<ref>; else --base <ref>; else
  origin/main. Diff is three-dot `base...HEAD` (merge-base diff = the PR's net
  change). Rename-aware via --find-renames. NO HEAD~1 fallback (which would see
  only the last commit of a multi-commit lane). If the base cannot be resolved
  or git fails, fail OPEN (exit 0, loud warning) -- the universal Orca infra-gap
  stance; in CI the base is always present (fetch-depth: 0).

HARD BOUNDARY
  Read-only. Fail-open ONLY for infrastructure gaps (no git, no PyYAML, base
  unresolvable). A PRESENT register that is unparseable, or a governed deletion
  with a missing/incomplete record, or a declared successor that does not
  resolve, is a real finding -- never fail-open. A MISSING register is treated
  as an empty register (so governed deletions become findings), not a skip.

MODES
  check_deletion_evidence.py --strict     fail (exit 1) on findings; CI gate
  check_deletion_evidence.py --report     same findings, advisory (exit 0)
  check_deletion_evidence.py --check      alias for --report
  check_deletion_evidence.py --selftest   pure-function cases; exit 0/1
