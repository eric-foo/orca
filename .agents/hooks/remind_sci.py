"""Smallest-Complete-Intervention reminder hook (advisory, never blocks).

WHY THIS EXISTS
  The Smallest Complete Intervention (SCI) rule lives in AGENTS.md, near the top
  of a large instruction surface. Over a long session -- and especially while
  authoring durable artifacts, where scope creep is most tempting -- SCI can drift
  out of active context. This hook re-injects the SCI rule at the COMMIT boundary,
  right before Claude commits durable artifacts, so the rule is top-of-mind at the
  moment scope is locked in -- the cheapest point to still amend if the change crept
  past "smallest complete."

  Placement note: this is a PreToolUse hook matched on the shell tools and gated to
  `git commit`, so it fires ONLY for commits Claude itself runs through the Bash /
  PowerShell tool. A human committing in their own terminal is not seen -- add a real
  git pre-commit hook if you need to cover that path too.

  The rule is OWNED by AGENTS.md (-> "Smallest Complete Intervention"). To spare a
  fetch round-trip, this hook carries the rule's text INLINE as a verbatim mirror:
  the full definition -- including the cleanup/speculation clause -- rides in the
  reminder. KEEP `_SCI_VERBATIM` IN SYNC with that AGENTS.md section; if the section
  changes, update the constant.

BOUNDARY
  Advisory only. Emits `additionalContext` and ALWAYS exits 0; it never blocks a
  commit and makes no validation/readiness claim. Forward-only and low-noise: it
  fires ONLY when a `git commit` has durable-artifact changes pending in the tree,
  and stays silent for code-only / scratch / config commits.

SCOPE (in: durable artifacts; out: code/scratch/config)
  In  : docs/{decisions,product,prompts,workflows,migration,hygiene,review-inputs,
        review-outputs}/, .agents/workflow-overlay/, orca/product/
  Out : anything containing _scratch; docs/_inbox/; .agents/skills/; .claude/;
        orca-harness/ (and any path not under an in-scope prefix, e.g. .agents/hooks/).
  Pending changes are read from `git status --porcelain` (staged, unstaged, or
  untracked), so the nudge fires whether files were staged in a separate step or in
  the same `git add -A && git commit` one-liner.

MODES
  remind_sci.py --hook       PreToolUse hook (reads stdin JSON): if the command is a
                             `git commit` touching durable artifacts, emit reminder; exit 0
  remind_sci.py --selftest   pure-function scope / commit-detect cases; exit 0/1

_SCI_VERBATIM = """`Complete` is load-bearing. Do not underfix to minimize diff, ceremony, or
visible change; a slightly larger fix is correct when required for durable,
coherent, non-fragile completion.

`Smallest` is also load-bearing. Do not add unrelated cleanup, speculative
abstractions, broad rewrites, extra workflow ceremony, or nice-to-have
improvements.

When two candidate paths both satisfy the current request under this rule,
prefer the one with materially lower downstream lock-in -- the durable data,
schema, interface, or workflow shape that would be irreversible, costly to
roll back, or costly to maintain. Take the higher-lock-in path only when a
benefit necessary to the current request outweighs that structural cost; if
so, pause and surface the tradeoff for a decision before proceeding. This
narrows the choice among already-complete paths only; it never authorizes
speculative cleanup, future-proofing, or broader scope.

Whenever the user or instructions say **"smallest complete X"** -- including
phrases like **smallest complete fix, patch, edit, rewrite, refactor, review,
or answer** -- interpret it as **X performed under the Smallest complete
intervention rule above.**"""
