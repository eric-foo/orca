"""Stop hook — warn when a commit-once-whole shared file is left dirty (advisory).

WHAT THIS DOES
  At the end of a turn (a Stop event), warns if any of the three shared,
  interleaved "commit once, whole" files is left uncommitted. Those files are
  edited by every lane, so a dirty one blocks others from cleanly committing
  their own one-line edit (committing it would sweep the dirty pile into an
  unrelated commit). This is the turn-end backstop to the per-edit PostToolUse
  nudge in check_repo_map_freshness.py.

  The three shared files:
    - docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md
    - .claude/settings.json
    - .agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md

WHY (enforcement placement)
  "Commit the shared file immediately" was carried only by instruction. This is
  the substrate backstop, per the Enforcement Placement principle in
  .agents/workflow-overlay/validation-gates.md. Complementary to the per-edit
  PostToolUse nudge (map-specific) — this one is turn-end and covers all three.

HARD BOUNDARY — warn only, never block, never auto-commit.
  Exit 0 always. It returns a reminder via `additionalContext`; it does NOT
  exit 2 (which would block the Stop and force the agent to continue), and it
  does NOT commit anything (auto-commit on a shared branch is unsafe). It guards
  `stop_hook_active` to avoid any stop-loop, and fails OPEN on internal error.

MODES
  check_shared_files_dirty.py --hook       Stop hook (stdin JSON, exit 0)
  check_shared_files_dirty.py --check       human-readable check of the live tree
  check_shared_files_dirty.py --selftest    pure-decision cases

REGISTRATION (.claude/settings.json; Stop takes NO matcher)
  "Stop": [ { "hooks": [ { "type": "command",
              "command": "python .agents/hooks/check_shared_files_dirty.py --hook",

  Hooks load at session start; restart the session after editing settings.
