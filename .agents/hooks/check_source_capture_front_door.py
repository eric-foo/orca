"""Online source-capture front-door reminder (advisory, never blocks).

WHAT THIS DOES
  On a generic online-tool event (`WebSearch`, `WebFetch`), it attaches a
  one-shot, non-blocking reminder to Claude's context alongside the tool result:
  if the intent is to *capture or preserve a source as evidence* for an Orca
  decision, the sanctioned path is the Source Capture Armory runbook, not a
  free-form fetch/crawl. The *rule* — what the front door covers, the
  evidence-only scope, and the runner discipline — is owned by:

      .agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md   (-> "Online Source-Capture Front Door")
      orca-harness/docs/source_capture_agent_runbook.md   (the runner manual)

  This script does NOT restate that rule. It is a thin boundary nudge that
  references the authority above. If the rule and this checker ever disagree, the
  rule wins and this checker is the stale party.

WHY THIS EXISTS (enforcement placement)
  The runbook was reachable only if an agent already knew to open it; nothing
  caught the moment an agent decided to go online. Per the Enforcement Placement
  principle in
      .agents/workflow-overlay/validation-gates.md  (-> "Enforcement Placement")
  a load-bearing routing rule that is checkable at a tool boundary is enforced at
  that boundary, not left to actor memory. The owner chose ADVISORY (reminder,
  never deny): a free-form lookup of, e.g., library docs is legitimate and must
  not be blocked; only *source/evidence capture* belongs in the runbook, and the
  agent — not this hook — makes that judgment.

SCOPE (low-noise by design)
  - Fires ONLY for the generic online tools `WebSearch` and `WebFetch`. It does
    not touch dedicated MCP tools (docs lookups, browser, computer-use), which are
    frequently legitimate non-evidence use. The doctrine applies to any online
    source capture regardless of tool; the hook is the precise, low-false-positive
    arm of it.
  - Never blocks. PreToolUse returns exit 0 with an `additionalContext` note and
    no permission decision; Claude receives the note alongside the tool result.
  - Fails OPEN on any error, so a bug here can never stop a tool call.

MODES
  check_source_capture_front_door.py --hook       PreToolUse hook (stdin JSON, exit 0)
  check_source_capture_front_door.py --selftest    decision-logic self-check

This is advisory tooling, not validation, readiness, source-access authorization,
or a source-access-boundary amendment. It reminds; it never grants permission to
run any capture.
