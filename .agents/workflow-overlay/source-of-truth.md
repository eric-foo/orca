# Source Of Truth

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Orca overlay authority
scope: Source hierarchy, conflict rules, doctrine-change propagation, and known source documents.
use_when:
  - Resolving Orca source precedence.
  - Checking whether a document is a known Orca source.
  - Changing product, architecture, workflow, validation, review, output, or lifecycle doctrine.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
```

## Current Source Hierarchy

1. Explicit user instruction for the current turn.
2. Orca `AGENTS.md`.
3. This overlay under `.agents/workflow-overlay/`.
4. Orca docs under `docs/`, when they do not conflict with the overlay.
5. Explicitly invoked or resolver-loaded skills may provide task-local mechanics only; they are not Orca project authority.

## Conflict Rules

- Orca overlay wins for Orca project facts.
- External workflow sources do not own Orca project authority. Skills may provide task-local mechanics only when explicitly invoked or resolver-loaded.
- Installed global/user/plugin skills are runtime copies or external tools, not Orca project authority.
- If a required source is missing, report a visible failure and name the missing file or decision.
- Source hierarchy is not a read-all list. Use `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md` and `docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md` to choose bounded source packs.

## Checkpoint Artifacts

Checkpoint artifacts capture transient lane state for recovery or transfer:
precompact working packets (`workflow-precompact`, under `docs/hygiene/`), cold
cross-lane handoff packets (`workflow-handoff`), and any equivalent lane-state
resume/snapshot note. They are convenience copies, never an Orca source of truth.

- Non-authoritative. A checkpoint's volatile claims — what is built, what is
  authorized, current doctrine, or "where we are" — are orientation only.
  Re-confirm any such claim against the canonical source (the owning
  decision/contract/overlay), or against disk for build state, before relying on
  it. The source hierarchy above governs; a checkpoint never overrides it, even
  when more recent.
- Single-consumption, one live instance per lane. A checkpoint exists to be consumed once; the consuming lane deletes it after recovery checks run and live state is re-established. Refresh by overwriting in place under a stable name — do not accumulate `_v2`/`_v3` copies. A checkpoint whose work has landed (committed/settled) is retired by deletion.
- Point, do not copy. When a checkpoint must carry a volatile fact, record a
  pointer plus a re-confirm instruction (for example "authorization -> <decision>;
  build state -> glob disk"), not a copied snapshot that silently goes stale.

This binds how Orca uses the `workflow-precompact` and `workflow-handoff` skills:
the skills supply mechanics, this overlay owns the lifecycle. It does not apply to
Orca source-of-truth artifacts (decisions, contracts, architecture records) or to
pointer-indexes (the repo map, this overlay) — those are the canonical sources a
checkpoint points to and must never be deleted as "consumed." It also does not
apply to authored handoff *prompts* under `docs/prompts/handoffs/` (the
Planning/Implementation handoff prompt role): those are docs-only prompt
artifacts, not lane-state checkpoints, and keep their own role lifecycle.

## Doctrine Change Propagation Contract

Doctrine-changing work is any source-changing edit that changes a durable rule
future agents may follow for product doctrine, architecture doctrine, workflow
authority, validation philosophy, review authority, output authority, or a
lifecycle boundary.

Use these trigger values:

- `product_doctrine`
- `architecture_doctrine`
- `workflow_authority`
- `validation_philosophy`
- `review_authority`
- `output_authority`
- `lifecycle_boundary`

Each `direction_change_propagation` receipt keeps `trigger` as one primary
trigger for backward compatibility and route clarity. If a source-changing edit
materially touches additional doctrine dimensions, add `related_triggers` as a
list using the same trigger vocabulary. `related_triggers` is discovery and
routing metadata only: it does not replace the primary trigger, reduce the
required controlling-source update, or reduce downstream surface checks.
An additional doctrine dimension is material when it changes which downstream
surface must be checked, changes which future agent route can rely on the
receipt, or is explicitly identified by a source, review, or receipt as a
secondary propagation risk. Do not add `related_triggers` for incidental topic
overlap, examples, quoted vocabulary, or context that does not affect routing
or downstream checks.

Before claiming completion for doctrine-changing work, update the controlling
source and check the downstream source-loaded surfaces that could continue to
route agents by stale doctrine. At minimum, consider:

- top-level agent instructions such as `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`;
- the controlling overlay file under `.agents/workflow-overlay/`;
- start-route and source-loading surfaces such as
  `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md` and
  `docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md`;
- executor, prompt, validation, review, and closeout surfaces when the doctrine
  affects them.

Keep propagated restatements faithful to the controlling source's strength. A
restatement in a downstream surface must not soften or narrow the controlling
rule — for example a `required`/`must` weakened to "add when known" — nor
silently fork it. Where the same wording would otherwise be copied across
surfaces, prefer pointing them at the single controlling source over duplicating
it, so the copies cannot desynchronize.

Store the propagation evidence inline in the changed artifact, prompt, handoff,
or final closeout. A controlling file keeps at most the two most recent receipts
inline; older receipts move verbatim to `docs/decisions/dcp_receipts_archive_v0.md`,
the single authorized standalone receipt archive. The inline receipts section must
end with one pointer line to the archive. No standalone receipt files other than
the authorized archive.

Use this receipt shape:

```yaml
direction_change_propagation:
  doctrine_changed: "<one sentence>"
  trigger: product_doctrine | architecture_doctrine | workflow_authority | validation_philosophy | review_authority | output_authority | lifecycle_boundary
  related_triggers: [] # optional discovery/routing metadata; does not reduce required checks
  controlling_sources_updated:
    - "<path>"
  downstream_surfaces_checked:
    - "<path>"
  intentionally_not_updated:
    - path: "<path>"
      reason: "<why unchanged>"
  stale_language_search: "<query, or not_run + why — not_run only for a purely additive change>"
  non_claims:
    - "not validation"
    - "not readiness"
```

If propagation cannot be completed, return an explicit blocker instead of a
completion claim:

```yaml
direction_change_propagation_blocker:
  doctrine_changed: "<one sentence>"
  trigger: product_doctrine | architecture_doctrine | workflow_authority | validation_philosophy | review_authority | output_authority | lifecycle_boundary
  related_triggers: [] # optional discovery/routing metadata; does not reduce required checks
  blocking_surface: "<missing, conflicting, or unchecked path/source>"
  attempted_check: "<what was attempted>"
  allowed_next_step: "<narrow action that would unblock propagation>"
  non_claims:
    - "not validation"
    - "not readiness"
```

The receipt or blocker is propagation evidence only. It is not validation,
readiness, approval, acceptance, proof, implementation authorization, or source
promotion.

    Orientation/research subagent dispatch now binds a third dimension — the
    return shape. prompt-orchestration.md (the subagent-contract owner) now
    requires, for a subagent whose output an agent will consume (act on,
    summarize, or route — even if later shown to a human), a terse schema-bound
    verdict (named fields, one line each, a file:line cite per load-bearing
    claim, `unknown` for an absent field) instead of a prose dump, validated by
    the spawning CA on receipt. The load side stays owned by the source-readiness
    rule and source-loading.md; the new rule defers to them and binds only the
    return shape. The behavior contract gains a CA-facing pointer rather than a
    separate local return rule. Additive and orthogonal to the two existing
    subagent rules: source-readiness (prompt-orchestration.md, above it) and
    forked-context runtime-payload safety (decision-routing.md).

    The subagent return-shape contract (prompt-orchestration.md, the
    subagent-contract owner) now also covers execution / source-changing
    subagents — ones that edit, install, commit, push, or open a PR. Their
    schema-bound return must additionally carry lifecycle-verification fields
    (branch, base and commit SHA, push/PR state, `merged` state) plus a
    per-surface change list with one file:line cite each, so the dispatching CA
    verifies the durable target on a fresh read per AGENTS.md rather than trust a
    `done`. A raw diff dump is not a substitute (it is a prose dump in another
    form), and `merged` must reflect observed state, never an assumption.
