# Source Of Truth

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Orca overlay authority
scope: Source hierarchy, conflict rules, doctrine-change propagation, and known source documents.
use_when:
  - Resolving Orca source precedence.
  - Checking whether a document is a known Orca source.
  - Changing product, architecture, workflow, validation, review, output, or lifecycle doctrine.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
```

## Current Source Hierarchy

1. Explicit user instruction for the current turn.
2. Orca `AGENTS.md`.
3. This overlay under `.agents/workflow-overlay/`.
4. Orca docs under `docs/`, when they do not conflict with the overlay.
5. Explicitly invoked or resolver-loaded skills may provide task-local mechanics only; they are not Orca project authority.

## Conflict Rules

- Orca overlay wins for Orca project facts.
- External workflow sources do not own Orca project authority. Skills may provide task-local mechanics only when explicitly invoked or resolver-loaded.
- Installed global/user/plugin skills are runtime copies or external tools, not Orca project authority.
- If a required source is missing, report a visible failure and name the missing file or decision.
- Source hierarchy is not a read-all list. Use `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md` and `docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md` to choose bounded source packs.

## Checkpoint Artifacts

Checkpoint artifacts capture transient lane state for recovery or transfer:
precompact working packets (`workflow-precompact`, under `docs/hygiene/`), cold
cross-lane handoff packets (`workflow-handoff`), and any equivalent lane-state
resume/snapshot note. They are convenience copies, never an Orca source of truth.

- Non-authoritative. A checkpoint's volatile claims — what is built, what is
  authorized, current doctrine, or "where we are" — are orientation only.
  Re-confirm any such claim against the canonical source (the owning
  decision/contract/overlay), or against disk for build state, before relying on
  it. The source hierarchy above governs; a checkpoint never overrides it, even
  when more recent.
- Single-consumption, burned after consumption. A checkpoint exists to be
  consumed once by the resuming or receiving lane. After it is read, its recovery
  checks run, and live state is re-established or superseded by a fresh
  checkpoint, the consuming lane deletes it. Do not leave a spent checkpoint to be
  re-trusted later as if current.
- One live instance per lane. Refresh a checkpoint by overwriting it in place
  under a stable name; do not accumulate `_v2`/`_v3` copies. A checkpoint whose
  work has landed (committed/settled) is retired by deletion.
- Point, do not copy. When a checkpoint must carry a volatile fact, record a
  pointer plus a re-confirm instruction (for example "authorization -> <decision>;
  build state -> glob disk"), not a copied snapshot that silently goes stale.

This binds how Orca uses the `workflow-precompact` and `workflow-handoff` skills:
the skills supply mechanics, this overlay owns the lifecycle. It does not apply to
Orca source-of-truth artifacts (decisions, contracts, architecture records) or to
pointer-indexes (the repo map, this overlay) — those are the canonical sources a
checkpoint points to and must never be deleted as "consumed." It also does not
apply to authored handoff *prompts* under `docs/prompts/handoffs/` (the
Planning/Implementation handoff prompt role): those are docs-only prompt
artifacts, not lane-state checkpoints, and keep their own role lifecycle.

## Doctrine Change Propagation Contract

Doctrine-changing work is any source-changing edit that changes a durable rule
future agents may follow for product doctrine, architecture doctrine, workflow
authority, validation philosophy, review authority, output authority, or a
lifecycle boundary.

Use these trigger values:

- `product_doctrine`
- `architecture_doctrine`
- `workflow_authority`
- `validation_philosophy`
- `review_authority`
- `output_authority`
- `lifecycle_boundary`

Each `direction_change_propagation` receipt keeps `trigger` as one primary
trigger for backward compatibility and route clarity. If a source-changing edit
materially touches additional doctrine dimensions, add `related_triggers` as a
list using the same trigger vocabulary. `related_triggers` is discovery and
routing metadata only: it does not replace the primary trigger, reduce the
required controlling-source update, or reduce downstream surface checks.
An additional doctrine dimension is material when it changes which downstream
surface must be checked, changes which future agent route can rely on the
receipt, or is explicitly identified by a source, review, or receipt as a
secondary propagation risk. Do not add `related_triggers` for incidental topic
overlap, examples, quoted vocabulary, or context that does not affect routing
or downstream checks.

Before claiming completion for doctrine-changing work, update the controlling
source and check the downstream source-loaded surfaces that could continue to
route agents by stale doctrine. At minimum, consider:

- top-level agent instructions such as `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`;
- the controlling overlay file under `.agents/workflow-overlay/`;
- start-route and source-loading surfaces such as
  `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md` and
  `docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md`;
- executor, prompt, validation, review, and closeout surfaces when the doctrine
  affects them.

Store the propagation evidence inline in the changed artifact, prompt, handoff,
or final closeout. Do not create a standalone receipt file, new skill,
registry, broad template sweep, or automation for this loop unless a later turn
explicitly authorizes that expansion.

Use this receipt shape:

```yaml
direction_change_propagation:
  doctrine_changed: "<one sentence>"
  trigger: product_doctrine | architecture_doctrine | workflow_authority | validation_philosophy | review_authority | output_authority | lifecycle_boundary
  related_triggers: [] # optional discovery/routing metadata; does not reduce required checks
  controlling_sources_updated:
    - "<path>"
  downstream_surfaces_checked:
    - "<path>"
  intentionally_not_updated:
    - path: "<path>"
      reason: "<why unchanged>"
  stale_language_search: "<query or not_run + why>"
  non_claims:
    - "not validation"
    - "not readiness"
```

If propagation cannot be completed, return an explicit blocker instead of a
completion claim:

```yaml
direction_change_propagation_blocker:
  doctrine_changed: "<one sentence>"
  trigger: product_doctrine | architecture_doctrine | workflow_authority | validation_philosophy | review_authority | output_authority | lifecycle_boundary
  related_triggers: [] # optional discovery/routing metadata; does not reduce required checks
  blocking_surface: "<missing, conflicting, or unchecked path/source>"
  attempted_check: "<what was attempted>"
  allowed_next_step: "<narrow action that would unblock propagation>"
  non_claims:
    - "not validation"
    - "not readiness"
```

The receipt or blocker is propagation evidence only. It is not validation,
readiness, approval, acceptance, proof, implementation authorization, or source
promotion.

    Orca now binds the Enforcement Placement principle into the overlay and

    Orca adds a second Enforcement Placement substrate: a repo-map freshness
    check (.agents/hooks/check_repo_map_freshness.py) that enforces the
    mechanically-detectable subset of the repo map's own stale_if: block at the
    write boundary (a PostToolUse Write|Edit hook) and as a portable --strict
    commit/CI gate. It reads the repo map AS its spec and references the map's
    stale_if as authority, never restating it; advisory and forward-only by
    default. High-precision gate triggers are a new top-level area (stale_if #1)
    and a new orca-harness runner/adapter (#2); source-of-truth edits (#5) are an
    advisory nudge only; judgment-shaped staleness (#3 spine reorg, #4 routing
    doctrine) stays with this Doctrine Change Propagation contract, which already
    lists the repo map as a downstream surface. A legitimate non-map change is
    acknowledged by a repo-map-ack: commit-message token or by the map's
    "do not enumerate" exclusion list; updating the map or a consolidation submap
    in the same change also satisfies the gate.
