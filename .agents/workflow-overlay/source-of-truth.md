# Source Of Truth

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Orca overlay authority
scope: Source hierarchy, conflict rules, doctrine-change propagation, and known source documents.
use_when:
  - Resolving Orca source precedence.
  - Checking whether a document is a known Orca source.
  - Changing product, architecture, workflow, validation, review, output, or lifecycle doctrine.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
```

## Current Source Hierarchy

1. Explicit user instruction for the current turn.
2. Orca `AGENTS.md`.
3. This overlay under `.agents/workflow-overlay/`.
4. Orca docs under `docs/`, when they do not conflict with the overlay.
5. Explicitly invoked or resolver-loaded skills may provide task-local mechanics only; they are not Orca project authority.

## Conflict Rules

- Orca overlay wins for Orca project facts.
- External workflow sources do not own Orca project authority. Skills may provide task-local mechanics only when explicitly invoked or resolver-loaded.
- Installed global/user/plugin skills are runtime copies or external tools, not Orca project authority.
- If a required source is missing, report a visible failure and name the missing file or decision.
- Source hierarchy is not a read-all list. Use `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md` and `docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md` to choose bounded source packs.

## Doctrine Change Propagation Contract

Doctrine-changing work is any source-changing edit that changes a durable rule
future agents may follow for product doctrine, architecture doctrine, workflow
authority, validation philosophy, review authority, output authority, or a
lifecycle boundary.

Use these trigger values:

- `product_doctrine`
- `architecture_doctrine`
- `workflow_authority`
- `validation_philosophy`
- `review_authority`
- `output_authority`
- `lifecycle_boundary`

Each `direction_change_propagation` receipt keeps `trigger` as one primary
trigger for backward compatibility and route clarity. If a source-changing edit
materially touches additional doctrine dimensions, add `related_triggers` as a
list using the same trigger vocabulary. `related_triggers` is discovery and
routing metadata only: it does not replace the primary trigger, reduce the
required controlling-source update, or reduce downstream surface checks.
An additional doctrine dimension is material when it changes which downstream
surface must be checked, changes which future agent route can rely on the
receipt, or is explicitly identified by a source, review, or receipt as a
secondary propagation risk. Do not add `related_triggers` for incidental topic
overlap, examples, quoted vocabulary, or context that does not affect routing
or downstream checks.

Before claiming completion for doctrine-changing work, update the controlling
source and check the downstream source-loaded surfaces that could continue to
route agents by stale doctrine. At minimum, consider:

- top-level agent instructions such as `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`;
- the controlling overlay file under `.agents/workflow-overlay/`;
- start-route and source-loading surfaces such as
  `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md` and
  `docs/workflows/orca_repo_map_v0.md`;
- executor, prompt, validation, review, and closeout surfaces when the doctrine
  affects them.

Store the propagation evidence inline in the changed artifact, prompt, handoff,
or final closeout. Do not create a standalone receipt file, new skill,
registry, broad template sweep, or automation for this loop unless a later turn
explicitly authorizes that expansion.

Use this receipt shape:

```yaml
direction_change_propagation:
  doctrine_changed: "<one sentence>"
  trigger: product_doctrine | architecture_doctrine | workflow_authority | validation_philosophy | review_authority | output_authority | lifecycle_boundary
  related_triggers: [] # optional discovery/routing metadata; does not reduce required checks
  controlling_sources_updated:
    - "<path>"
  downstream_surfaces_checked:
    - "<path>"
  intentionally_not_updated:
    - path: "<path>"
      reason: "<why unchanged>"
  stale_language_search: "<query or not_run + why>"
  non_claims:
    - "not validation"
    - "not readiness"
```

If propagation cannot be completed, return an explicit blocker instead of a
completion claim:

```yaml
direction_change_propagation_blocker:
  doctrine_changed: "<one sentence>"
  trigger: product_doctrine | architecture_doctrine | workflow_authority | validation_philosophy | review_authority | output_authority | lifecycle_boundary
  related_triggers: [] # optional discovery/routing metadata; does not reduce required checks
  blocking_surface: "<missing, conflicting, or unchecked path/source>"
  attempted_check: "<what was attempted>"
  allowed_next_step: "<narrow action that would unblock propagation>"
  non_claims:
    - "not validation"
    - "not readiness"
```

The receipt or blocker is propagation evidence only. It is not validation,
readiness, approval, acceptance, proof, implementation authorization, or source
promotion.
