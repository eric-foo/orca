# Artifact Roles

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Orca overlay authority
scope: Orca artifact role bindings, permissions, freshness markers, and paired artifacts.
use_when:
  - Binding an artifact role for Orca work.
  - Checking artifact permissions or protected roles.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
```

This file binds reusable artifact-role mechanics to Orca-owned paths. Generic workflow methods may request these roles, but Orca owns the concrete permissions, destinations, freshness checks, and validation evidence.

## Role Bindings

| Role | Authoritative source or destination | Read / write permission | Freshness marker | Paired artifacts | Validation evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Orca overlay authority | `.agents/workflow-overlay/` | Read for all Orca work; write only for explicit overlay maintenance | File contents plus git status | `AGENTS.md` | Source list and changed overlay files |
| Product thesis authority | `docs/decisions/orca_product_thesis_consumer_demand_v0.md` (supersedes `turn_08_product_thesis_v0.md`, 2026-06-12) | Read for planning; write only when explicitly updating the thesis | Decision ID, status, date, and hash when pinned | Product and feature planning prompts | Source list and decision status |
| Full prompt artifact | `docs/prompts/` or a typed child folder under it | Read/write docs-only prompt drafts | File path, version suffix, source list, and optional hash | Thin wrapper, review input, rerun prompt | Prompt validation gate result |
| Prompt template | `docs/prompts/templates/` | Read/write docs-only Orca-local prompt templates | Template ID, version suffix, template target if applicable, and registry entry | Template registry, full prompt artifact, thin wrapper | Registry lookup and leakage check |
| Thin wrapper prompt | `docs/prompts/wrappers/` | Read/write docs-only wrapper drafts | Referenced full prompt path and hash or revision | Full prompt artifact | Wrapper-delta check |
| Planning handoff prompt | `docs/prompts/handoffs/` | Read/write docs-only handoff prompts | Work unit ID, target source revision, and output mode | Feature plan, implementation handoff, review input | Preflight check and validation plan |
| Review prompt | `docs/prompts/reviews/` or `docs/review-inputs/` | Read/write review requests; reviewers are read-only unless explicitly assigned patch execution | Source paths, hashes or revisions, and review lane | Review report | Review-lane and source-hash check |
| Rerun or patch prompt | `docs/prompts/reruns/` or `docs/prompts/patches/` | Read/write docs-only retry or patch prompts | Prior artifact path, prior hash or revision, frozen fields, mutable fields | Prior artifact, patch queue, review report | Rerun economy check |
| Review report | `docs/review-outputs/` or a typed child folder under it | Read/write reviewer findings reports; overlay-bound verdicts only when the review lane or prompt binds them | Reviewed artifact path and revision | Review prompt, patch queue | Findings list, review-use boundary, and overlay-bound verdict only when requested |
| Patch queue | `docs/review-inputs/` or `docs/workflows/` | Read/write ordered patch candidates; source changes require separate execution authority | Stable unit IDs and target files | Rerun prompt, review report, implementation handoff | Residual-work and validation-gate mapping |
| Workflow record | `docs/workflows/` | Read/write Orca workflow records | Date, source list, and hashes when material | Prompt artifacts, decisions, validation notes | Gate evidence and residuals |
| Product artifact | `docs/product/` | Read/write docs-only product contracts, product proof plans, evidence standards, source maps, satellite notes, decision artifacts, memo substrates, evidence appendices, and executive-deck shape drafts | File path, version suffix, source list, and decision status when applicable | Product planning prompts, feature planning prompts, decision records | Product artifact impact classification and source list |
| Research artifact | `docs/research/` | Read/write docs-only public/source research artifacts, evidence-only lane outputs, candidate screens, synthesis reports, backtestability notes, and reject-pattern maps | File path, version suffix, source list, query list, and date boundary when applicable | Product artifacts, decision records, prompt artifacts, backtest-prep notes | Evidence/source list, missing-field labels, synthesis boundary, and non-claims |
| Hygiene queue | `docs/hygiene/` | Read/write docs-only triage queues and cleanup notes | Queue item ID, status, and target destination | Inbox material, prompt artifacts, product artifacts, workflow records | Triage status and promotion or disposal note |
| Inbox scratch | `docs/_inbox/` | Read/write temporary docs-only scratch; not authoritative | Creation note or queue item ID when retained | Hygiene queue | Promotion, archive, deletion, or `not authority` note |

## Protected Roles

- External workflow source outside this workspace is read-only from Orca work unless a later turn explicitly authorizes external source changes.
- Installed global, user-level, plugin, and project-local skills are deployment copies or tools, not Orca project authority.
- `jb` project rules, paths, handoffs, GAP/CV Engine policy, lifecycle mechanics, and repo-local skills are not Orca artifact roles.
- Material in `docs/_inbox/` is not Orca authority until promoted into an accepted docs folder or overlay file.

## Retrieval Metadata

New or materially touched durable human-authored workflow artifacts should
follow `.agents/workflow-overlay/retrieval-metadata.md` when the artifact may
affect future routing, planning, review, proof, validation, prompt, or overlay
work.

Retrieval metadata helps future agents find and interpret artifacts. It does
not change any role binding, permission, freshness marker, paired artifact,
validation evidence, source-of-truth status, or authority boundary in this
file.

## Failure States

- `BLOCKED_UNBOUND_ARTIFACT_ROLE`: a prompt or workflow references a role not listed here or in another accepted Orca overlay file.
- `BLOCKED_ROLE_PERMISSION`: requested work exceeds the role permission.
- `BLOCKED_ROLE_DRIFT`: a role points to stale, missing, or conflicting evidence.
