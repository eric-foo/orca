"""Registration-integrity check -- every artifact a shared registry names must exist.

WHAT THIS DOES (a CI-promoted, workspace-independent defect check)
  Verifies the checked-out tree's internal consistency: a shared registry/config
  names an artifact by path; that artifact must be present in the tree. A dangling
  reference breaks a fresh clone -- e.g. a hook registered in .claude/settings.json
  whose script file is missing errors on every matching tool call.

  This is the SINGLE workspace-independent, false-positive-free signal promoted to
  CI. The workspace-local health nudges (uncommitted pile-up, worktree sprawl,
  "present locally but not yet on main") are deliberately NOT run here.

CHECKS (selectable with --checks; default = all)
  hook-registration   For every hook `command` in .claude/settings.json, verify the
                      registered Python script exists as an in-tree regular file.

SCOPE (narrowed after the GPT-5.5 cross-vendor review, findings F1-F4)
  This check covers the `python[3] <script>.py [args]` hook-command form -- which is
  the only form ORCA uses. A hook command it cannot verify in that form (a non-python
  interpreter, `python -c`/`-m`, or a first positional that is not a `.py` script) is
  reported as `unverifiable` and FAILS the check (never silently passed) -- extend the
  check or convert the hook. It does not (yet) verify `.sh`/`.js`/extensionless hook
  artifacts; that would be a deliberate, separate broadening, not assumed here.

WHY THIS IS SAFE TO RUN IN CI
  - Decidable from the checked-out tree ALONE: reads .claude/settings.json and the
    filesystem. No base ref, no git history, no network -> a shallow CI checkout
    works and it cannot false-positive on "new in this PR, not yet on main".
  - Directional: a registry entry must have its file (entry -> file). It never flags
    a file that merely lacks a registry entry.
  - In-tree regular file only (F1): a registered script counts as present only when it
    resolves to a regular file INSIDE the checkout -- a same-named directory, a symlink
    to a directory, or an absolute / `..`-escaping path does NOT satisfy it.
  - Precise script extraction (F2): the script is the first positional token after the
    `python` interpreter, per `;`/`&&`/`||`/`|`-separated segment -- so a compound
    command is not missed and an option value like `--config x.py` is not mistaken for
    the script.
  - Fails LOUD: an unknown/empty --checks, an unreadable settings file, an unverifiable
    hook command, or an internal error all exit non-zero. It never silently runs nothing
    -- a silent no-op could mask the very defect it guards.

EXIT CODES
  0  every selected check passed (or there was genuinely nothing to verify)
  1  a selected check found a dangling reference or an unverifiable hook command
  2  misuse or internal error (unknown/empty --checks, unreadable settings)

ENFORCEMENT REACH (honesty)
  A non-zero exit fails the PR's check run. Without server-side required-status-checks
  (ORCA branch protection is 403-blocked on a private/free repo), that is a STRONG
  signal under merge-when-green / structure-B discipline, NOT a server-enforced merge
  gate. It does not, by itself, block a merge.
